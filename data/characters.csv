Homer Simpson,True,False,True,True,False,1,Cartwright,1,"He is a crude, ignorant, and slobbish individual, although he is fundamentally a good person and shows great caring and loyalty to his family, friends and on occasion, to those he barely knows or those he considers his enemies.
 Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abe Simpson II and the late Mona Simpson, but he has two illegitimate half-siblings on Abraham's side. He is married to Marge Simpson and has three children with her: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty Bouvier and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.
 Homer could just simply be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.
 Born somewhere in Springfield, Homer has a floating timeline, making his birth and childhood difficult to place. Homer once had a driver's license issued in 1992 which gave his date of birth as May 12, 1956. Similarly, he said he was 24 years old in 1980. In the 1990s, Homer daydreamed about watching President John F. Kennedy on television and scaring cows as a child in 1963. In the 2000s, Homer mentioned being ten years old in ""the '60s or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s"". He was in high school somewhere from 1974 to 1999. Homer was also depicted as a young adult in the mid to late 1990s. His mother was said to have disappeared the year of an early Super Bowl in the 1960s which Joe Namath was in, or circa the 1980s to 1990s, about 30 years before the Patriots traded Brady.
 Homer Jay Simpson was born to Abraham and the now late Mona Simpson. He was raised on the Simpson family farm until they were forced to move out because Homer was jumping out of a hay bale and scaring the cows into giving sour milk, making the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer started to drink alcohol like his father did and accidentally caused a traffic jam in a Playskool car. According to a family tree designed by Matt Groening, the creator of the show, Mr. Charles Montgomery Burns, his boss, is a distant relative of him. You could view the family tree showing Homer's known family members and ancestry here if you'd like. 
 When Homer was around six or nine years old, his mother went into hiding following a run-in with the law. Homer mentioned Abe told him she died while Homer was at the movies although in another episode's flashback Abe told Homer she was dead when she had already been missing for a while. Before her disappearance, Mona took Homer and Abe to Woodstock, where Homer ended up briefly adopting the hippie lifestyle, much to Abe's disapproval. Homer discovered she was alive either seven or twenty-seven years later.
 When Homer was 10 years old, his father forced him to attend Camp See-A-Tree, where he went on a date with Marge Bouvier from Camp Land-A-Man; unfortunately, though, he fibbed about his name and sustained an injury while Marge was changing her appearance. Later Homer, accidentally stumbled into Camp Flab-Away and escaped too late to meet up with her again, which is something that left him as heartbroken as Marge.
 When Homer was 12, he, Lenny, Carl, and Moe went to a deep gorge to swim but the water was drained. When investigating why the lake was reduced to a muddy pit, he stumbled upon a decomposing corpse inside a nearby pipe, greatly traumatizing him.
 When he was 15, Homer participated in a drinking contest by lying that he was 22. However, he became so intoxicated to the point that he ended up drinking a whole entire beer keg used to fill the other contestants cups. Eventually he was hungover enough that he missed almost a complete month of school.
 Before he began high school, Homer convinced his best friend Barney Gumble to have a can of beer while his father was asleep. Barney, an aspiring student preparing for Harvard, was annoyed and reluctantly drank it. However, he took to alcohol so quickly he permanently became an even worse drunken wreck than Homer and presumably failed at his SAT tests.
 When Homer attended Springfield High School, he began to fall in love with an older and unrecognizable Marge after she ultimately rejected Artie Ziff. He failed remedial science and thus didn't graduate from high school. Marge and Homer later on bought an apartment at Springfield Place together. During this time, Marge received a letter accepting her into a college. To pay for her tuition, Abe gave his son a job at Simpson Laser Tag. The couple broke up for some time after Homer started a grunge band called Sadgasm. Marge later realized that she really loved Homer and went back to him. According to other episodes, however, Marge did not pursue a career or go to college because she stayed with Homer, or because her parents filed for bankruptcy after being sued for Lenny falling off the roof of Marge's house at a party Sasha Reed held.
 At some point between finishing high school and marrying Marge, Homer served in the U.S. Army for a brief amount of time but never saw combat. Due to a clerical error, he was discharged early, and years later, after a disastrous dinner party with his old sergeant, Homer was forced to complete his tour of duty.
 Homer and Marge kissing on their wedding day. In his 20s, Homer was working at Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre, turning the crank that spun the windmill. He was still dating Marge, although Homer lived in an apartment with Barney, while Marge was now living with her sisters and mother. After a night out with Marge, he learned that he'd prematurely impregnated her with their first child, who they decided to name ""Bart"" if it turned out to be a boy. He got married with Marge at Shotgun Pete's, a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spent their wedding reception alone at a truck stop before ending up at the house of Marge's family.
 After an unsuccessful attempt to get a job at the power plant, Homer eventually left Marge to support his family. He went to work at the restaurant Gulp 'n' Blow until Marge convinced him to return home with her. As a result, Homer confronted Charles Montgomery Burns and secured a job at the plant. Homer and Marge later moved into a tiny apartment together on the Lower East Side of Springfield. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, Homer and Marge moved into their first house. Homer's second leap to stardom was his success as the lead singer and songwriter for the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, even winning a Grammy. During his time with the group, Homer was frequently absent which put stress on his marriage. After the group broke up due to creative differences, Homer went back to Springfield.
 When in his 30s, Homer prepared a budget so that he could work at his dream job, a pin monkey at the Bowlarama Bowling Alley, owned by Barney's uncle Al Gumble. The budget included buying regular toilet paper and that only one of the kids could go to college. Unfortunately for Homer, Marge became pregnant once more with Maggie around this time, and he reluctantly went back to the nuclear plant in order to support his family. Since then, Homer has started many jobs, but in the end, he always comes back to his job at the Nuclear Plant.
 Homer's childhood was a tragic one. His mother had to exile at a young age and his father never took notice to Homer. This caused Homer to be very insecure about himself and underachieving things, thinking he lacked the skills to do so, which left him behind in almost everything and likely caused him to be what he is today.
 Homer had quite an amount of jobs throughout the show's run. The episode ""Homer Scissorhands"" had him work as a hairdresser, but then he got tired of it and returned to his old job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.
 In the episode ""Homer's Odyssey"", he worked at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as a technical supervisor. He was fired by Barry Mackleberry (right in front of Bart Simpson), who was his supervisor, for creating a deadly gas leak. He was later rehired to safety inspector for Sector 7G, after complaining about the safety of the plant itself. Ironically, the accidents that occur at the plant have doubled every year since Homer was made safety inspector.
 Homer as Santa. Homer rarely attends his job, and yet seldom gets fired (and when he does get fired, he always ends up rehired in some way) and always has his job waiting when he plans to get rehired and has impulsively quit occasionally to pursue other careers, although he always ends up quitting or losing these jobs. On one occasion, Homer has misinterpreted a threat about losing his job as a hint that he can take the following day off.
 Homer also applied for a job as Santa, to make up for his missed Christmas bonus at the power plant.

 Homer has committed a very wide range of crimes and infractions, from ticket-worthy offenses to felonies. He spent little time in jail for his actions, but if he were to be found guilty of all the counts detailed below, he could find himself sentenced to life in jail for more than 350 years and fined somewhere in the range of $120 million (and lose custody of his children, in the child abuse/neglect case). Here is a list of run-down of Homer's crimes, along with some prime examples:
 Homer's first appearance. Homer The Fluppet as seen in ""The Fight Before Christmas"". Evolution of his belly. Homer's appearance is that of an overweight balding man. Despite his overweight status, and hate for exercise, he has on occasion shown surprising physical prowess and agility for a man of his body type, such as when training for Whacking Day and he hits several pop-up Snakes with kicks and even back-flipping. His baldness is contributed by several factors, such as upon finding out whenever Marge was pregnant, he would tear out a substantial amount of his hair. Another contribution is working at the nuclear plant for so many years that the exposure to radioactivity has caused most of his hair to fall out. Another frequent topic on Homer's obesity is his large posterior which is often joked about by Bart. His eyes are blue, and he is 6 feet tall (183 cm). While his weight is debatable, the most common weight given is 239 pounds (though many jokes about his weight would suggest he is much heavier than that). He wears a white polo shirt, blue jeans, white underpants, and gray loafers.
 He and the rest of his family were initially really crudely drawn and badly animated in the early seasons of The Tracey Ullman Show (as shown in the 1st picture you spot above from the Good Night short), but they eventually streamlined the characters and they now look like what they do today.
 An X-ray of Homer's true brain Homer is a pure moron who can go back and forth from being downright terrible to an extremely caring and loving man. Homer's personality is one of frequent immaturity, frequent stupidity, selfishness, laziness, and explosive anger; one might say it's like that of the ""Average Joe"". He also suffers from a short attention span, which complements his intense but short-lived passion for hobbies, enterprises, and various causes. Despite his family flaws, he is a loving and devoting father and husband, even if he can be ignorant or oblivious to his family's feelings and ideas. When he thinks he's let anyone he loves down, it really does affect him, and in the end, he will do anything for them. Another contribute to his ""Working Joe"" persona is that he has also shown to be sensitive about his masculinity; being initially upset over Marge becoming a police officer as he thought it made her ""the man of the house"", as well as refusing to call a contractor when Marge wanted her kitchen remodeled as to not emasculate his pride.
 
Homer is noticeably prone to emotional outbursts; he gets very envious of his neighbors, the Flanders family, and is easily enraged at his son, Bart, and strangles the boy in an exaggerated manner. His trademark phrase to strangling Bart is ""Why you little...!"" and on one occasion, ""Why you little bastard!""  He also spanks Bart sometimes and, in one case, Lisa. One time, he was too busy to spank them, so he told them to go to their rooms and spank themselves. He does not show compunction about this, and is not attempting to hide his actions from people outside the family, even showing disregard for his son's well-being in other ways, such as leaving Bart alone at a port, or allowing Bart to go court for skateboarding naked on his dare when all he would have to do is attend a one-hour parenting class signifying not only his disregard for Bart but his extreme laziness.
 Homer grossing out Patty and Selma Homer also possesses an extreme dislike for his sisters-in-law, Patty and Selma Bouvier. This is because they often talk down on him for the kind of man he is, selfish and dimwitted. He also openly calls them ugly. He uses labels such as ""The Gruesome Twosome"", ""Fatty and Smellma"" and ""Two Sobbing Trolls"". He also gave his children the impression that Patty and Selma are horrible and nasty witches, which is the reason why the kids don't like spending time with their aunts. The sisters in turn, hate Homer as much he hates them. Patty and Homer have a very vile, antagonistic relationship but his relationship with Selma has rarely softened up over the years.
 Homer's anger While Homer has repeatedly upset people and caused all sorts of mayhem in Springfield, these events are usually caused by either his explosive temper or lack of foresight. Except for expressing annoyance at Ned Flanders, Homer's actions are usually unintentional. Most of his explosive anger is targeted on Bart, because of something stupid or bad he says or does. Despite their disadvantages, these common outbursts saved Homer from dying of a pent-up, rage-induced heart attack. Although he usually has an explosive temper, there are a few instances, usually in very serious situations, where Homer's anger was so subdued yet so immense that he outwardly appeared calm and spoke in an even-handed tone despite very clearly being outraged. Notable examples of this include when he learned that Bart had gone on a road trip via a fake license and are stuck in Tennessee doing odd jobs: He outwardly acted as if he was calm, and had to obscure his face to vent his anger enough to fog up his visor before adopting his calm exterior and vowed to send him money to get home before darkly stating that he'll murder him as soon as he gets home before Lisa talks him out of it. Another instance of this was when learning that Mr. Burns didn't address him in his thank you card, where, after lowering the letter in an angry manner, he calmly requests that Bart and Lisa step outside for a second, with Bart and Lisa doing so without question and immediately due to being very scared at Homer's evidently furious appearance (although he then promptly manages to scream what is heavily implied to be the f-bomb after they've left in a loud enough volume that all of Springfield stopped what they were doing in shock). He also reacted like this to his father after the latter revealed that not only was Homer's own conception an accident, but implied that he would have been happier if he had never been born: After learning this, Homer gasped and braked to a stop immediately, before twice sternly telling Abraham Simpson to step out of the car in a calm yet clearly infuriated tone while scowling and not even looking at him, and then promptly driving away fast. He also initially acted like this when forced to adopt a swear jar and having to put coins in the swear jar to curb his swearing habits. When getting himself injured twice by accidentally breaking his thumb by whacking his thumb as well as impaling his foot with a nail deep enough as to require a tetanus shot, he initially robotically stated his first injury and then talking in a pseudo-kindly manner the second time while twitching with rage, before stating that, while he won't swear, he will kick the doghouse down, the last part he states by screaming it out in clear rage.
 Homer performing manual labor While Homer's stupid antics often upset his family, he has also performed acts that reveal him to be a surprisingly loving father and husband, such as selling his cherished ride on the Duff Blimp and using the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself, giving up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear; spearheading an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well, even though he hates doing physical labor and arranging a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their lousy first ceremony, even going so far as to hire one of The Doobie Brothers as part of the wedding band and getting a divorce from Marge, essentially making their second wedding a ""real"" one.
 Despite his hatred of manual labor, Homer does a surprising amount of DIY work around his home. He built a jungle gym, a costume of Florida for Lisa, a birdhouse and spice rack for Marge (however, these are shabby at best and two of them actually fell apart). He also remodeled his kitchen when Marge felt insecure about hers after meeting the neighbor's deluxe one, however, this was more because he felt emasculated when Marge tried to phone a contractor.
 Homer asleep in Church Homer's stupidity and ignorance make him clueless to sensitive matters as well as when he is being insulted or his life is in danger. An example is when he came close to drinking a beaker of sulfuric acid but was spared after his colleague, Frank Grimes knocked the acid out of his hand. Instead of being shocked, Homer only responded with jovial delight and laughter. He was also completely oblivious to Grimes' hostility towards him, only being aware that the two of them were enemies after the latter made it painstakingly clear. Homer was an atheist and anti-gay. He adheres to no religion and only goes to church because Marge constantly forces him to. However, he was once referenced to be Muslim in ""Peeping Mom"". In ""Homer the Heretic"", he quits church altogether but later chooses to go as he was saved from an inferno, which is in his eyes a miracle. In the climax of the same episode, he is seen falling asleep during Reverend Lovejoy's sermon. He also paid no respect to Jesus' resting place after being granted a trip to Bethlehem by Ned Flanders; however, he did come to believe himself a messiah after suffering a hallucination from days in the desert while searching for Ned (who actually just got a glass of tepid water).
 Homer tends to derive amusement from the misfortune of others. One time, he was even amused by a documentary about car crashes which result from alcoholism. He is a chronic thief and borderline kleptomaniac which ranges from petty to grand theft, stealing everything from TV trays to power tools and air conditioners, even an entire room of the Flanders House from Ned Flanders. He has also stolen golf balls from the local driving range, office supplies (including computers) from work, and beer mugs from Moe's Tavern.
 Homer has a vacuous mind, but he is still able to retain a great amount of knowledge about very specific subjects. He often shows short bursts of astonishing insight, memory, creativity, and fluency with many languages! Homer is also extremely confident; no matter how little skill or knowledge he has about anything he tries to do; he has no doubt that he will be successful. However, his brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed by much longer and more consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a low IQ due to many factors. Some of which include: his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive cranial trauma, and the crayon lodged in the frontal lobe of his brain. He also implied that he would have been at least a bit smarter and more athletic, if not by a substantial amount, if his father had tried to give him encouragement rather than beat him down. Another large factor of Homer's unintelligent is his inheritance of the ""Simpson Gene"" which causes all male members of the Simpson family to become more and more unintelligent as they grow older. It is also implied Homer repeated second grade.
 Young Homer shoving crayons up his nose Aside from the Simpson Gene, the cause of his simple-mindedness has been attributed to either Homer lodging a crayon in the right lobe his brain at the age of six or from head trauma, also at the age of six, from Homer accidentally tying his laces along with some cans to the bumper of Grampa and Rita LaFleur's car after their wedding and being dragged along the asphalt by mistake.
 Despite his handicap, Homer does have a degree of long-term, calculated planning of what might happen, such as when, shortly before taking his ""forget-me-shot"" from Moe Szyslak, requested for their anniversary party to have a Moon Jump, due to realizing exactly what will happen afterwards.
 While Homer's lack of intelligence and short attention span normally just results in him looking like a fool, it also sometimes causes him to unintentionally bring harm to the people around him. One example is when he dumps a piece of industrial garbage in the garbage can at Krusty Burger, followed by a lit match which he used to light a victory cigar. The combination of the two caused a fire on the supply lines for the fast-food chains of spring field and caused chain reaction destroying all the restaurants in the process.
 Also, it also makes him less aware of how what he says might affect people emotionally, like for a note quiz where he asked Ned Flanders about his sexual life, forgetting that his wife had passed away six months prior. His ignorance at one point even cost his family their home since he didn't understand how a home equity loan worked, putting them massively in debt and making it so they could no longer afford their mortgage. Though luckily, the house was purchased by Ned, who allowed them to rent the living space. Later on, Homer and Marge were again the legal owners of the property.
 Homer imagines himself in the Land of Chocolate Homer has at times debated against his brain. Occasionally, a specific body part such as his face, stomach or liver is also shown debating with his brain. In one notable scene, Homer's mind actually leaves his body out of boredom, causing him to collapse. Homer is also inclined to retreat into fantasy, such as daydreaming of Germany as ""the land of chocolate"".
 Homer's attitudes toward women, romance, and sex are occasionally shown. While Homer's marriage with Marge is occasionally strained, it seems generally happy. Despite this, Homer is often tempted with other women, and usually shows no qualms with gawking at (and drooling over) attractive women. Homer almost had an affair with Mindy Simmons, but ended up not wanting to. He has made the occasional remark denoting his attraction to other women (including his neighbor's wife), even in front of Marge on an occasion, but always shows his devotion to Marge in the end.
 In earlier seasons (such as Season 1), Homer's personality was different. Homer was an angry, grumpy, ignorant man who got embarrassed by his family (instead of the other way around) but generally loved them. He also was prone to angry outbursts, such as yelling at Bart and Lisa, strangling Bart (which has continued in later seasons), and giving Krusty the Clown the middle finger in court after Homer had assumed it was him who robbed the Kwik-E-Mart.
 Homer looking and behaving like The Incredible Hulk Homer has since developed into a less intelligent and meaner person in later seasons. Homer's ""angry personality"" still sometimes surfaces up, usually whenever getting pressured by Bart. One of the more notable examples of this is when Bart published a series of Angry Dad animated cartoons which made fun of Homer's anger and stupidity. Ironically, Homer responded by only reinforcing his angry personality, which culminated in him spilling green paint on himself and making noises similar to those of The Incredible Hulk.
 Based on the ""Disco Sucks"" bumper sticker he removed from his old car when about to sell it before leaving Marge, he was not fond of the Disco genre.
 Despite attending church every Sunday, Homer is not very religious, and it is likely that he only attends church because he knows that Marge would be hurt and shocked if he did not. He does not seem to practice Christian morals and frequently sleeps in church, much to the annoyance of Reverend Lovejoy. He also admitted that in addition to sleeping in church, he also mentally undresses the female churchgoers. He often mispronounces the name of the Christ, calling Him ""Jebus"". In ""The Simpsons Movie"", before entering church, he says, ""Relax, those pious morons are too busy talking to their phony-baloney God.""
 When asked by Bart what religion Homer belongs to, he replies, ""You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life. Uh... Christianity"".
 Homer's brief cultist opinion about real Christian Despite this, he is a Christian and willingly attends church after Ned, Apu, and Krusty saved him from a house fire. He was also inadvertently baptized by Ned, initially reacting violently before speaking in a religious manner, and returning to his normal self thereafter when questioned by Ned. Homer also tried to become a good Christian in ""'Tis the Fifteenth Season"".
 However, in ""The Greatest Story Ever D'ohed"", Homer thinks that he is the Messiah due to Jerusalem syndrome.
 Homer had actually met God face to face several times and has even gotten permission from him in a dream to skip church.
 Homer became a superhero named Pie Man when the Rich Texan offends Lisa. He chucks pies in the faces of evildoers or people who deserve to be pied, uses the basement as a Pie Cave and his car as the Piemobile. Bart is his sidekick as Cupcake Kid. He also tried to don a graffiti alias as ""El Homo"", which was meant to be a Mexican take on his name but erased it when he realized the alias was Spanish for homosexual.
 Homer is one of the four best friends (Lenny, Carl, Moe), who call themselves ""The Guys"".
 Homer's skills seem to vary greatly. Sometimes, Homer can find it difficult to run to the smallest distances before passing out from exhaustion, and other times, he has exceeded the prowess of gold medal Olympians. He can have trouble understanding the simplest of concepts to being able to build a functional robot with a working A.I. His physical strength is just as random: At times, he is too weak to even kill a fly by punching it, while at other times, he is able to lift a motorbike above his head, and use it as a sword effortlessly and throw punches that send people flying with ease.
 Additionally, in his youth, Homer was once a very talented gymnast, even catching high school Marge's eye with his ability. Unfortunately, his father's lack of faith in him caused him to blunder in front of the entire school, which promptly led to the end of his career.
 Homer also is a proficient bowler. He once bowled a perfect game, leading to short-term fame for him.
 Homer has shown to have near-superhuman endurance and durability, repeatedly surviving accidents that could easily kill other people. His well-padded stomach allowed him to survive direct cannon fire to the stomach with no immediate injuries, although later it was found that repeated fire had destroyed his stomach which could have killed him.
 Homer injured Homer's skull is a quarter-inch thicker than the average skull (dubbed ""Homer Simpson Syndrome"") that protects him completely from cranial injury up to a certain point allowing him to be beaten by normal folk with no effect but can be hurt by significant force such as getting punched in the face by the world heavyweight boxing champion or falling repeatedly down Springfield Gorge. At one point, Homer even survived having every bone in his body broken from a fall that would have liquefied a regular person. Another time, he managed to get back up and walk around from being mauled by a badger in a failed and foolish attempt to get it out of Santa's Little Helper's doghouse despite having his entire gut torn out and exposing his intestines (which the badger somehow accomplished without ripping his shirt. This could have been accomplished by the badger going under Homer's shirt instead of attacking him through it).
 Homer is constantly ending up in sticky situations, such as being caught in a fire on at least four occasions, almost drowning, animal attacks and more. In some episodes, he ""almost dies"" twice, and in one episode, Frank Grimes' son was trying to murder Homer, and all through the episode Homer ended up in situations that would normally kill a person. In Homer Scissorhands, he tries to commit suicide by drinking a container of disinfectant. Once realizing it did nothing to him, he questions why nothing ever seems to kill him, even several simultaneous heart attacks.
 Homer in the hospital Homer is not a stranger to pain. He gets hurt in one form or another in almost every episode and frequently breaks bones and ends up in the hospital. He has also needed several life-saving operations, such as a triple bypass and suffering four simultaneous heart attacks. In one episode, Marge gets concerned at how much Homer almost dies as a result of sticky situations and begs him to get life insurance where we find out that he has also had three strokes and is, therefore, not insurable.
 In an interview with Matt Groening, he jokingly states that Homer is unable to die due to God finding him far too entertaining to kill off and enjoys his pain-induced suffering.
 One skill that remains somewhat consistent throughout the series is his musical talent. Homer can play the guitar amazingly well, play the piano like a natural, and is an accomplished singer and songwriter. He has been part of several bands which were all extremely popular. He won a Grammy for barbershop, numerous golden records for his grunge band, which is also a music style he claimed to have invented, and was able to help Lisa win a music contest using songs he wrote for her. While lying on his back, Homer possesses a powerful operatic voice that while at hospital stops crying babies and even revives a flat-lined patient, leading him to become a wildly popular opera star.He is even a great conductor, being able to lead the untrained kids of Springfield Elementary into playing a flawless rendition of Stars and Stripes Forever. He also been shown to play the bass.
 Homer is a talented fighter, fighting with great combat prowess in his duel with Peter Griffin, Smithers, Tom, Meathook and George H.W. Bush. Homer's immense physical strength often varies for comedic purposes, though he is portrayed as being considerably strong, able to lift a motorbike above his head, and use it as a sword effortlessly.
 Like Bart, Homer is a polyglot, someone with the ability to pick up languages fairly quickly, perhaps even a hyper polyglot (a polyglot fluent in more than six languages). He has been shown to speak Spanish, Chinese, Penguin and Drunk and when he and Bart were imprisoned in Japan for a seemingly short amount of time due to unknowingly assaulting Emperor Akihito, he was able to speak the language fluently by the time he left. He was also able to pick up a few Indian words by watching Apu and Manjula argue (though it is highly likely that he wrongly interpreted some part of their argument, as Homer claimed he thinks ""Manjula"" is some kind of spaceship, though the other word interpreted by Homer, Saala, does mean ""jerk"" in some sense in Hindi). He was also shown to mimic people's voices especially well. This was evidenced in a flashback in Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy, where Homer, after watching a televised speech made by then-President John F. Kennedy, proceeded to flawlessly mimic Kennedy's speech pattern and mannerisms.
 In addition to being able to accomplish what no man of his health and standing could, Homer has been able to accomplish things that defy all logic and reason whatsoever, such as causing cornflakes and milk to burst into flames and cause a nuclear meltdown in a testing van, despite no fissionable materials being present in it at the time.
 Even though Homer is consistently depicted as being unpopular his entire life, he has been able to incite a mob on multiple occasions. He has incredible sway over crowds and is able to motivate people for just causes, such as shutting down the nuclear plant, and also to calm down an angry mob- something very difficult to do- such as when he prevented the destruction of Springfield's burlesque house. Like Bart, he is almost always made leader in whatever bizarre situation he comes across, although, unlike Bart, that leadership isn't always appreciated, such as when Homer becomes the leader of the Stonecutters, which shortly afterwards causes all of the members to quit.
 Homer's appetite is so insatiable, Captain McCallister remarked him as a ""Remorseless Eating Machine"". He once cleaned out The Frying Dutchman, and effectively sued the place for running out of food, thus not being able for him to eat ""All He Can Eat"", because he was still not full.
 Homer while varying in physical ability from episode to episode has been consistently portrayed as a binge drinking, overeating, accident-prone daredevil who puts absolutely no thought into what his actions will cost him, all of which has made it impossible to get any form of insurance which concerns his health. A magazine health test calculated Homer's lifestyle would lead him to pass on at 42.
 Homer is in the hospital in at least one episode every season and has had several life-saving operations, not including the one for his triple heart bypass which he needed after his arteries were clogged with cholesterol. He also had at least two separate series of stress-induced heart attacks from learning of how much money Mr. Burns offered Lisa to repay her for her ""help"" in restoring his fortune and especially her refusal of said money: The first, upon witnessing Lisa tear up the check, was severe enough that he promptly collapsed and, according to Dr. Hibbert, underwent four simultaneous heart attacks. The second, which was after Lisa corrected him regarding just how much she actually refused, was severe enough that it caused a Code Blue alert at the Hospital.
 Years of working in a substandard nuclear facility have left his blood irradiated to show up on an x-ray without the dye that is normally required to make the blood visible having to be administered, as well as having rendered him sterile.
 Homer's gluttonous eating habits Homer loves food, he can almost always be seen eating far more than any one man could possibly eat alone. His favorites are foods which he knows are bad for him and will blatantly refuse healthy food such as oatmeal and fruit in favor of fatty meals. He particularly enjoys donuts. Though he has tried multiple times to switch to a healthier diet, he has always ended up reverting to his unhealthy eating habits after a relatively short amount of time. He was once willing to die upon eating a poisoned éclair despite knowing it would kill him, only to throw it away in horror when Lisa claimed it was low fat. There was only one known time where he DIDN'T engage in gluttonous eating patterns, or indeed, ANY eating at all, which was when Kent Brockman was breaking down on the air when attempting to apologize for commiting fraud regarding news stories, with his admitting he was too shocked and mesmerized by Kent Brockman having a visible breakdown on the air to even attempt to eat.
 Homer once grew to 300 pounds so that he could go on disability for work.
 Homer also seems to have a problem with his sense of hearing, as the result of both attending and putting on loud rock concerts regularly in his youth. In addition, an incident with Bart shown in the episode ""Barthood"" in which Bart blasted an airhorn into his ear until it began bleeding may have further compounded this. This may explain why he can so easily phase out what people are saying to him, intentionally or otherwise.
 Homer has been shown as having concentration problems.
 Homer is the same age as Marge, making him about 34 at the time Marge took bowling lessons with Jacques. While telling the story of hi was 32 and marriage to Marge, Homer recalled being 33 on the night Shinnosuke was conceived 6 years earlier, making him 35. In 1993, Homer's driver's license, issued in July 1992, gave his date of birth as May 12, 1956, making him 37 years old by the time his license was revoked. When Homer and Grampa began selling the Simpson &amp; Son Revitalizing Tonic, Grampa said Homer was an accident after he took the tonic 38 years ago. At the time Homer started boxing, Marge said he was 38 years old. At the time Homer decided to become an inventor, Marge said he was 39. Later, during his road trip to Oregon, Homer said he was 38 years old. When Lisa discovered Marge had a college diploma, she said Homer and Marge were ""almost 40"" and calculated they could not have had 10-year-old Bart until ""way after high school"". Later on, after Grampa briefly moved back in to Evergreen Terrace, Homer said that ""Sometimes you have to wait until you're 38 to discover who you really are."" Some accounts suggested Homer's age is as low as 33, as his mother Mona disappeared 27 years before Mona found Homer alive in his grave, and Homer was six years old when Grampa gave up Bongo and when Rita LaFleur left Springfield, both of which happened after Mona left her family. In another episode, however, Homer recalled that his childhood trauma of losing his mother happened when he was nine. In The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family, a book written by The Simpsons' creator, Matt Groening, Homer is 36 years old.
 There are multiple theories on how Homer lost his hair. Earlier episodes suggested that he was simply a victim of male pattern baldness (A problem he told Bart was ""Hereditary""). One theory suggests that Homer ripped out some of his hair when he realized Marge was pregnant with Bart, then more when he found out she was pregnant with Lisa, and tearing out a single hair when he found out she was pregnant with Maggie (this couldn't be possible as he is shown having different reactions to the realization that his wife was pregnant). It is also very possible he lost his hair from the radiation at the nuclear plant.
 ""Marge on the Lam"" was the closest to the truth, and possibly the truth, as it is (almost) explained visually: Homer also volunteered for an army experiment because he didn't want to have dinner with Marge's sisters. The army doctor attempted to warn him that the side effects of the experiment were ""hair loss, giddiness and the loss of equilibrium"", but Homer ignored him.
 Another theory is that Homer's hair was once squirted with some kind of acid, thus causing permanent hair loss.
 Despite being married to Marge throughout the entire show, Homer has had a number of romantic encounters.
 Homer is the husband of Marge Simpson. They met when they were younger without learning who each other was before meeting again properly in high school. They have had three weddings. The pair have a very strong marriage which has survived cheating, amnesia and many arguments. They have been in love since their high school senior year.
 Mindy Simmons was an attractive employee at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant who has nearly everything in common with Homer. They attended a convention together and nearly had an affair. After Homer turned her down, he later says that she ""hit the bottle pretty hard and got fired"".
 Lurleen is a waitress who Homer helped in launching a successful singing career. She attempted to seduce him without any success. She has been married multiple times to men that all look like Homer.
 Amber was a waitress at a casino in Las Vegas and was Homer's Vegas wife. Homer accidentally married her when he and Ned Flanders got drunk. Ned married the other waitress at the casino named Ginger. Doing the only decent thing they could, they ran from them.However, after a long time, the waitresses managed to track them to Springfield, and Amber went to live to the Simpsons house and revealed to Marge and the children about her marriage to Homer, which infuriated Marge to the point to she threw Homer out of the house, and later the family managed to get her drunk and made her marry Abe, which made her run back to Vegas. Amber died from a drug overdose.
 When Homer becomes a famous Opera singer, he attracts the attention of horde of fans including a stalker by the name of Julia. She confesses to Homer that she is his to do with as he wants, becoming his personal assistant and attempting to seduce him at every turn. When he proclaims that his heart belongs to Marge, she attempts to kill him with no success.
 Annie was an FBI agent who was investigating Homer after Lisa said he could be a terrorist. What makes this interesting is that we know Homer does consider her attractive, and he even called her beautiful in her debut episode. It's implied in ""Homerland"" that she has romantic feelings for him, but nothing came from it since it was her first and so far, only appearance.
 Homer in jail Moe is the owner of Moe's Tavern and is Homer's main supply of beer, making him a very important person in Homer's life. Homer spends a lot of his time talking to Moe in his tavern and seems to go to him whenever he has a problem in his life. Homer has also helped Moe with his love life. Moe has told Homer before that he is his best friend and they both seem to be in understanding that the two are ""life partners."" Despite this, Moe once risked Homer's life in exchange for a shot at being a notable name in the boxing community again, but in the end, his friendship for Homer proved stronger than his dream and he literally flew in and saved Homer from getting beaten during a match. Even so, Moe has been known to point a shotgun at Homer for various reasons (see ""Pygmoelian"" and ""The Parent Rap"").
 Barney Gumble is one of Homer's best friends. They were both born in 1956, making Homer the same age as Barney. They have been friends since childhood (one time getting drunk from Abe Simpson II's beer and ""wrapping Homer's wagon around a tree"") but have been best friends since high school. Homer was the one who first convinced Barney to try beer and inadvertently caused him to throw away a potential life at Harvard and instead become an alcoholic.
 Lenny and Carl are Homer's co-workers at the Nuclear Power Plant, and they were familiar with Homer in their childhood days. They are Homer's most frequent companions at Moe's Tavern, after Barney. Abe Simpson claimed to have bribed Lenny and Carl to be his friends at a young age. Even though both Lenny and Carl have wives, they seem to be attracted to each other.
 Homer has been depicted as friends with Monty Burns on many occasions, such as when they got drunk together at a baseball game or were on a bowling team together. On the other hand, Burns has also sworn eternal vengeance against Homer on just as many occasions, and even more so than that Burns seems to be unable to remember who Homer Simpson is (a running gag on the series) despite the fact that almost all of his major life events are related in some way to Homer. Usually, Homer is afraid of Burns and acknowledges his presence with a scream, but it has been shown that once the two warm up to each other, they get along famously until Homer inadvertently does something to end the friendship.
 In addition, although Homer usually takes Mr. Burns' failure to remember his name in stride, there has been one instance where this caused a lot of anger from Homer, which was during the Sun Blocker incident. Homer attempted to get Mr. Burns to remember his name, with his eventually sending a chocolate box with a photo of the family stuck in. However, he didn't get thanked for this (although in that case, it's because Mr. Burns ended up throwing away the box while one candy was left, with the last candy obscuring Homer's face), causing him to be infuriated enough to give a horrendous swear in a loud enough volume that all of Springfield stopped in shock. He eventually resorted to vandalizing Mr. Burns' office to spray-paint his name and even physically assault his boss to force him to remember his name, although this ended up failing with Mr. Burns referring to him as an ""unidentified assailant"". Ironically, the one time he DOES remember Homer's name actually nearly got Homer into deep trouble when he was considered the suspect for the shooting against Mr. Burns, which had him assaulting Mr. Burns at the hospital to stop him from claiming that he shot him (unaware that Mr. Burns was simply parroting Homer Simpson's name in a half-lucid state due to regaining consciousness). Because of this, Homer was notably one of two characters whose grudge against Mr. Burns during that time had absolutely nothing to do with either Burns Slant Drilling Co. or the Sun Blocker, the only other being his daughter Maggie Simpson, the actual culprit.
 Homer telling Ned how crazy he is. Ned Flanders is Homer's perfect neighbor whose belongings are usually ""borrowed"" by Homer and are never given back. Homer takes obvious advantage of his push-over neighbor and is usually an avid participant in the one-sided rivalry the two have going on, although Ned sometimes gets caught up in Homer's taunts (such as when the two pit their sons against each other in a putt-putt tournament). It has also been hinted that Homer lusts after Flanders' wife, Maude (now deceased). Homer enjoys insulting Flanders and making his life more difficult, which Flanders all takes in stride. Even so, Homer has genuine feelings for his neighbor; he feels truly guilty when he causes Flanders' business to sink and takes it upon himself to save the Leftorium, he makes it his personal duty to revive Flanders' love life after Maude passes, and he also invites Flanders to his barbecues and other events with genuine enthusiasm. He has also acknowledged that Ned is his best friend, referring to him on one point as ""Stupid Best Friend Flanders"". Homer loves to see Flanders struggle because he perceives the Flanders' lives to be the unobtainable perfection that he will never have, and he especially loves beating Flanders, but he hates when Flanders is totally crushed. There are also incidents where Homer inadvertently causes harm to Flanders. A notable example of this is when Homer ends up unwittingly releasing a radioactive ape into Flanders' house after the ape in question tricked Homer, resulting in it occupying the attic. This incident also resulted in Flanders having to report it to Chief Wiggum at the Police Station, a report caught on CCTV camera, and eventually acquired illegally by Comic Book Guy.
 Apu and Homer are good friends; their families get together for dinners and they regularly have conversations when Homer is purchasing some confection at Apu's Kwik-E-Mart. When Apu lost his job at the Kwik-E-Mart, he stayed with the Simpsons, Apu's wedding was also held at the Simpsons, and when Apu needs help with some problem the wacky solution and implementation usually include Homer (stealing Apu's children from the zoo, letting Apu use Homer's family as his own when his mother visits to dodge having to go through with an arranged marriage).
 Clancy Wiggum is a friend of Homer and he and Homer have shown their relationship in ""Chief of Hearts"", when Homer gave sandwiches to him. They have been friends since. Even before then, they also were at the very least acquaintances, notably being invited to barbecues by Homer, as well as Homer and Wiggum, alongside the other townspeople, often plotting to do activities when they are annoyed at recent events (such as their wives pushing them away because of Apu overindulging his wife for Valentine's Day, and the events of the Presidential Election in Springfield).
 Homer's relationship with his children fluctuates greatly from episode to episode.
 Homer's highly abusive tendencies Homer's relationship with his son Bart is a rather strange one, indeed; Homer has threatened Bart with murder before and attacks him occasionally, yet at other times, the two get along better than anybody else. Homer usually refers to Bart as ""the boy"" and has mentioned spanking and beating Bart before. All that is ever shown, however, is either Homer growling and lunging for Bart, chasing him, or else strangling him. Homer was held in a mental hospital once due to his aggression with Bart, although, once the doctors realized that Bart was, in fact, real, they released him. It is implied that Bart is the reason that Homer is bald. Homer blames most of his misfortunes on Bart and is the strict abuser of Bart in the strict abusive family. As a result, Bart usually takes advantage of his father's stupidity to humiliate him (as he does with most authority figures). Because of their often-turbulent relationship, Bart commonly refers to Homer as Homer instead of Dad, especially when Bart is humiliating him. Homer has also implied that he wouldn't mind if Bart changed 100% and that he isn't very attached to him as he is.
 Bart and Homer are relaxed Homer and Bart share the same sense of humor and adventure and therefore are almost always partners during wild escapades, such as when Homer became a truck driver or when they were arrested together in Japan. They spend a lot of time together watching TV, and although they spend a lot of time together, Homer doesn't take much of an interest in his life while Bart mostly ignores Homer. Whenever Homer does partake in a father-son activity with Bart, it is usually to beat Flanders at something, although, interestingly, Homer is truly offended when Bart gets a ""big brother"" to spend time with. Although Bart oftentimes acts resentful of Homer, he really loves when his father shows an interest in him, in fact, when he cheated on an IQ test and was labeled a genius, consequently winning Homer's affection, he was reluctant to admit he had cheated (even though he was miserable at school) simply because he didn't want matters to go back to how they had been with Homer and his greatest fear is Bart becoming a homosexual.
 A possible explanation for Homer's frequent mistreatment or neglecting of Bart was provided in ""Barthood"". There, Homer states that the day he found out about Bart was the day his life of youthful independence was over, which frightened him as it meant he had to become a breadwinning patriarch despite his unreadiness. Truth be told, Homer admits to being just as insecure and misunderstood as his son and also like him, only wants to be accepted by his loved ones.
 However, Homer also frequently shows genuine care for Bart and has expressed that he loves him, in spite of their differences and treatment of one another. He truly is ashamed whenever he embarrasses Bart and he tries to be a better father to Bart than Abe was to him, for example, he overly supports Bart when he is on the football team because his father never once supported him. Homer has even risked his life to impress Bart, such as taking a cannonball to the stomach because he realized that doing so caused Bart to idolize him. He was even willing to jump across Springfield Gorge to help Bart understand the stupidity of risking one's life for short-lived thrills and glory. At times, Homer can also be protective of Bart. As when George Bush spanked him, Homer, in a rage, started a pranking war that led to a brutal fight against the former president. When Bart was trapped down a well, his father stopped at nothing to dig a hole to find and save him. He was even enraged that Bart's former therapist strangled him and sued the man. In addition, Homer has also ""protected"" Bart from the horrible sight of a nude Patty by bleaching his son's eyes, something that his son appreciated. Also, when he took note of Bart's rather merciless mimicking of Abe's ""Gorgeous Godfrey"" persona on other children, Homer berated his father for this.
 Homer is very protective of Lisa and shows a soft side to her that Bart has never seen. She is his little girl and when Homer disappoints her or makes her sad, he will often times go to the end of the earth to make things right. Homer sometimes does activities with Lisa which he doesn't enjoy simply to make her happy, such as attending the ballet. That being said, Lisa and Homer do not get along very well. When Homer does accompany Lisa on such intellectual trips, he oftentimes embarrasses her, usually by either falling asleep, saying something rude or unintellectual, or else displaying disgusting habits (scratching his butt, burping, etc.). When Lisa becomes upset, Homer can't usually figure out what it is he did wrong. They have little to talk about because of their differences in interests and intellectual caliber, so Homer far prefers to do tasks with Bart and leave Lisa alone.
 He is often annoyed by her love of her saxophone and constantly yells at her to tell her to stop making a racket. Lisa is also the moral center of the family, which leads to further clashes between her and Homer, who doesn't really care about the ethics of the various situations he has been involved in. Lisa's intelligence is likely the largest cause that Homer and she do not get along better. Whenever Lisa does make an attempt to protest or explain something to her father, she usually uses such advanced vocabulary that Homer simply nods and replies, ""Yes, sweetie,"" even though it makes no sense whatsoever in the context of the conversation.
 However, Homer is very proud of Lisa's intelligence and will brag about it to friends and co-workers. Lisa acknowledges her father's shortcomings but does love him and appreciates when he puts in the effort to better himself for her sake. Although he is often insensitive to her and her needs (once turning her room into a cellular tower without a second thought and then forcing her to bunk with Bart- also without a second thought), Homer does try to be a good father and puts her happiness above anything else. For example, when he was first told that she was gifted and that she should find a mental stimulation to help with her gift, he gave up the $200 dollars the family had saved for a new air conditioner to buy her saxophone instead and earned gratitude from her. In Homer Is Where the Art Isn't, Lisa secretly got an art painting out while switching the painting with a bag, and Lisa wanted to be closer with Homer.
 Homer with Maggie Homer forgets Maggie exists—frequently. Once, when talking about their ""two"" children, Marge interrupted and told Homer that they had three children, to which he replied that the dog didn't count as a child before recalling Maggie. Similar dialogue is recurrent throughout the series. Also, whenever Maggie is referred to by her full name, Margaret, Homer has no clue as to who is being referenced. When Homer does try to interact with Maggie, he oftentimes frightens her unintentionally.
 Homer is highly irresponsible with Maggie, often giving her dangerous objects to play with and once completely losing her because she crawled out of her crib. Maggie was an accident baby (as was Bart and Lisa) and having her meant that Homer had to quit his dream job at the bowling alley and instead take his job back at the nuclear power plant so that he would make enough money to support a third child. This was not ideal for Homer because he had only recently quit from the power plant in a very rude and flamboyant fashion. When he returned, Smithers and Burns had a good gloat that he was crawling back and, to further depress him, installed a plaque dead center in front of his desk that read, ""don't forget, you're here forever"".
 Because of all this, Homer fiercely resented the prenatal Maggie, but, as soon as he first laid eyes on her, he immediately fell in love. There are no baby pictures of Maggie in the Simpson household because Homer hangs them ""where he needs the most cheering up""-- at work. In his office, he has created a mural of Maggie's baby pictures which strategically cover up one half of the N and the entire T of don't, the GET of forget, the YOU'RE, the E of here, and the FOREVER on his plaque with pictures of Maggie, so that it reads ""do it for her."" It can be argued from this that Maggie cheers up Homer more than his other two children.
 Although they don't communicate well, Homer and Maggie share a special bond and he loves her deeply. Maggie's first word was ""daddy"", which he couldn't hear (due to being out of Maggie's room and shutting the door as he exited). Maggie once saved a captive Homer, who was impressed and grateful to his daughter. He has shown love for Maggie as he protected her from bullying babies in ""Eeny Teeny Maya, Moe"" and earned a hug from his daughter who punched out a baby that knocked him down. Homer later saved her from being carried off by a bald eagle and made sure to hold her close, while punching the bird so it wouldn't try to take her again.

 Matt Groening first conceived the Simpson family in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. He had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts, and had intended to present his Life in Hell series. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening chose to go in another direction. He hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, with Homer being named after his father. Homer then made his debut with the rest of the Simpsons clan on April 19, 1987, in the Tracey Ullman short ""Good Night"". He was the first character to speak in the series. Homer's middle initial ""J"", which was revealed to stand for ""Jay"", was a ""tribute"" to Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose from Rocky and Bullwinkle, a show Matt Groening loved as a child. According to Matt Groening, the whole family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.
 Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening. In a series of interviews in 1990, Groening reportedly stated that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day of the Locust, a 1939 novel by Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson, but neither explanation is considered definitive.
 Homer's voice sounds different on the shorts and Season 1 to early/mid-Season 2 of the half-hour show than the seasons that followed. Dan Castellaneta's earliest portrayal began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but developed into a more robust and humorous voice during late-Season 2 and Season 3, allowing Homer to convey a wider range of emotions. Castellaneta changed the voice, as he could not sustain his Matthau impression for the 9-10 hour long recording sessions and had to find something easier. During an interview with the cast of the show on Inside the Actors Studio, Castellaneta stated that Homer's voice was based in part on his own father who often spoke with an exuberant tone.
 Starting in the ""Punching Bag"" short, the phase has now become part of the English Dictionary He also popularized the catchphrase ""Mmm..."". Many examples of other ""Mmm...""s are ""Mmm... candy"", ""Mmm... pointy"", or ""Mmm... hug"". He has used it less lately.
 He also has another catchphrase: ""Woo Hoo!"" He says this when something goes right for him. When something goes wrong for him, he says, ""D'oh!"".
 On May 30, 2003, Homer was made an honorary citizen of Winnipeg, Canada, in recognition of Matt Groening's father Homer Groening, who is believed to be from the Manitoba capital.
 Homer placed second on TV Guide's 2015 Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters, behind Bugs Bunny. In 2005, Homer was listed fifth on Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters, one of only four cartoon characters on that list. British TV viewers voted him as the greatest TV character of all time. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly placed Homer ninth on their list of the ""50 Greatest TV icons"".
 The Simpsons has been recommended for use in the teaching of sociology to modern-day college students. The journal Teaching Sociology appraised it as ""particularly effective for illustrating sociological themes and encouraging critical thinking among today's undergraduates"".

 Homer was voted the greatest television character of all time by Channel 4 viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and a special-achievement Annie Award.

Marge Simpson,False,False,True,True,False,1,Kavner,2,"Marjorie Jacqueline ""Marge"" Simpson (née Bouvier) (Born March 19) is the homemaker and matriarch of the Simpson family. She is also one of the five main characters in The Simpsons TV series. She and her husband Homer have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a raspy and grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of careers ranging from a police officer to an anti-violence activist.
 Simpson Family (Season 22 Promo) Homer and Marge are the same age. The two have a floating timeline, making their birth and childhood difficult to place. Homer said he was 24 years old in 1980. In the 2000s, Homer mentioned being ten years old in ""the '60s or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s"". Homer and Marge were in high school anywhere from 1974 to 1999. They were also depicted as young adults in the mid to late 1990s.
 Marge Bouvier was born in Capital City to Clancy Bouvier, a photographer-turned-steward, and Jacqueline Bouvier. She is the youngest daughter of the Bouvier family. She has a pair of older sisters, the joyless twins, Patty and Selma, both of whom passionately disapprove of Homer Simpson. A family tree showing Marge's known family members and descendants can be seen here.
 Marge originally met and went on a date with Homer Simpson at Camp Land-A-Man when they were ten, though they did not realize that at the time as Homer used a different name and wore an eye patch, and Marge did not give her name and had burnt her hair so that it was brown.
 H.S.H./Her Serene Highness, the Princess Consort of Springfield, Duchess of Bouvier, and Countess of Simpson.
 Marge attended Springfield High School and in her senior year, she met Homer Simpson. She was wary of Homer at first but agreed to have a study date with him, only to find out that Homer was only doing this to get her to go to prom with him. She ended up going with Artie Ziff. Artie took her home and she later picked up Homer, who she found walking home, in her car. Marge told him how much she regretted going to the prom with Artie instead of him, causing Homer to fix the strap of her dress with the corsage he got her. After that decision, her sisters showed their discontent towards him and ultimately thought he was wrong for her.
 In one episode, Homer and Marge got an apartment together at Springfield Place. Marge was accepted into Springfield University, with Homer paying for her tuition from his job at Simpson Laser Tag. When Homer started a grunge band called Sadgasm, the two split up and Marge began a relationship with associate professor Stefane August. Marge, not appreciating Stefane did not want to be married, and realizing she was in love with Homer, got back together with Homer. According to other episodes, however, Marge did not pursue a career or go to college because she stayed with Homer, or because her parents filed for bankruptcy after being sued for Lenny Leonard falling off the roof of Marge's house at a party Sasha Reed held. At some point, Marge, who was still in a relationship with Homer, was living with her mother and sisters again, and Homer Simpson shared an apartment with Barney Gumble.
 Marge has always been rather innocent and has also been said to be rather awkward in certain scenarios, especially when she is drunk.
 An example of this is when Marge is taking place in a magic show as a contestant and at this time, she is rather drunk, so she keeps blabbering about certain things. The magician, Diablo, finds this annoying and pulls out a ball gag and while Marge is blabbering shoves it into her mouth, so her drunken talk becomes muffled sounds. This could also link to Marge's famous voice which throughout the Simpsons has been considered annoying.
 Marge continues to make muffled sounds from her gagged mouth while a sack is put over her head during the magic trick.
 After the two had been dating for several years, Marge and Homer got married in a small wedding chapel near the state line some time after Marge was pregnant with Bart.
 Marge is the mother of the Simpson family, who spends most of her time doing housework, caring for Maggie Simpson, being supportive of and indulging Lisa, and either disciplining or protecting Bart from Homer's wrath. Marge is the only member of the family who encourages church attendance. She also appears to have a significant athletic ability. She is bilingual, being fully fluent in French. Her marriage to Homer is also very strong. They once spurned to participate in a key party as soon as they realized what a key party was and promptly left, although Homer also took the key jar with them, most likely to find his car keys.
 Despite these tendencies, Marge has had her fair share of wild escapades throughout the history of the series. She worked as a police officer in Springfield, took therapy for flight fear,was a real estate agent, sold pretzels, was a painter, was imprisoned for shoplifting, became a gambling addict, showed alcoholic tendencies,was at one time known as The Listen Lady, was an unwilling participant in a cross-country police chase, overdosed on steroids, cheated on a cooking competition and developed amnesia.
 Although not a chain smoker like her eldest sisters Patty and Selma, Marge has engaged in smoking twice. One of these times, however, she was implied to be an attempt to drown out the smell of the Annual Chili Cook-Off to hide it from Homer as long as possible due to realizing if he was to find out he had immediately wanted to go there, as she was motivated to go with Homer after their last visit resulted in humiliation on her part when Homer, while drunk, stripped naked and proceeded to ""bathe"" himself in a cotton candy maker under the delusion he was a puffy pink cloud.
 Public exposure: in Large Marge. She flashes herself. In Natural Born Kissers she is completely naked in public.
 Officer Marge Marge has had many jobs, most of which lasted temporarily. These include:
 Marge is generally a very kind-hearted and loving woman. In contrast to her husband and son, Marge hardly ever swears and, except on occasional incidents, puts greater effort into controlling her temper. Despite this, she can be protective of her family when she needs to, especially during Homer's ""psychopath"" moments. However, she cares deeply about everyone she's closest too as well, even her husband. On occasion, she can sometimes get explosive outbursts of anger, but admits her errors and apologizes right after - in such incidents, she is primarily always forgiven but in others, she doesn't.
 Marge crusades against Itchy &amp; Scratchy Marge tends to consider anything that is not completely plain to be amazing or exotic, even if they are not all that special, such as oregano, deviled ham instead of normal ham and buttered noodles instead of un-buttered noodles. She has also been depicted as a killjoy who attempts to stop and even prohibit activities that other characters otherwise find fun - she always believes she has a good reason for doing so, even if it bothers or distastes her alone and nobody else. She once had Itchy and Scratchy banned because Maggie injured Homer after imitating a scene from the cartoon. She tried to demolish a burlesque house, and she outright says that if something isn't to her taste then no one else should be allowed to enjoy it. Homer sums up his wife when he tells her: ""If it were up to , all we would ever do is work and go to church"". Marge's plain attitude and love for her family are brought down many times including when she finds a Chanel suit and openly admits after going to a country club party that the rich are better than the way her family acts.
 In addition to her killjoy tendencies, Marge has also been shown to be a hypocrite on several occasions such as secretly keeping Homer's handgun for herself after disapproving of his use of it so much that he eventually chose to throw it away. Other occasions of her hypocrisy include using violent methods in order to protest against the violent Grand Theft Scratchy video game, as stated by Lisa, or disapproving the violence in Itchy and Scratchy, yet considering Michelangelo's David a masterpiece. In the Simpsons Comics #100 - Clip Clip Hooray, it is revealed that Marge would occasionally team up with Luann Van Houten, Agnes Skinner, and Sarah Wiggum in a sacred motherly conspiracy called ""The Motherlode"", where mothers throw away the comic book collections of their children, whenever they get big enough, then sell them off a bit at a time and use the money to buy motherly accessories. It is also revealed that the reason why no one can ever buy the Simpsons comics in Springfield is because Marge is so embarrassed by how the artists draw her that she buys all of the comics on New Comic Day and at Comic-Cons, while Bart and Lisa are at school. In ""Dead Putting Society"", Marge got mad at Homer, Bart, and Lisa for laughing at Ned Flanders' apology letter, only to go to the next room and giggle herself.
 There have also been occasions where Marge's wishes and demands have led to trouble at the expense of her family such as:
 Despite many of Springfield's occasional riots and animosity against any given member of the Simpson family, Marge is still shown to be very trusting, even towards her fair-weathered friends and acquaintances who criticize her family and her tastes on a weekly basis. Marge is definitely extremely unappreciated by her own children and husband. She constantly slaves over the children and Homer by cleaning up the messes they leave.
 As a parent, Marge is clearly the more stable person, but she tends to somewhat expect her kids to accept her method of parenting without question. This is often seen through Bart and Lisa when she will sometimes vocally express how she wants them to be as opposed to their current personalities, such as wanting Bart to be a well-behaved boy and somewhat expecting Lisa to be a mother and housewife like herself when she's an adult. Marge also tends to be outwardly supportive of the two during certain occasions but will show her true colors rather quickly, one time with Bart when he wanted to go on a school trip to a submarine and she asked what his favorite comfort food is as she didn't believe he could behave long enough and with Lisa when Marge revealed to Homer that she had been lying about being interested in jazz and mocked the genre. While she will often state the two should grow into independent adults and have families of their own, she also secretly states that the two should think of her as their closest friend and occasionally despises the thought of them thinking themselves separately from her and tries to keep them as close as possible.
 Marge has yellow skin and dark-blue hair styled into a tall curly beehive hairstyle. She usually wears a long strapless pale olive-green dress, orange low-heeled shoes, and a red pearl necklace. The necklace is a family heirloom, and she is seen to have a big drawer full of them. Doctor Hibbert revealed that she has webbed toes in ""Marge in Chains"". Marge remarked that she used to have a ""perfect 26-26-26"" figure. Later seasons have her described/depicted as very beautiful and physically attractive, and she has been sought after by several of the men in Springfield, most notably Moe, and even some of Bart's friends have noted her attractiveness.
 On special occasions, she wears a long sleeved dress with white pearls that are very similar to Lisa's.
 The original design of Marge As a teen, Marge had waist-length hair that she always wore down, but wore it in her trademark beehive for senior prom. In flashbacks showing Marge as a child, she is portrayed with her hair worn tall, which could mean she straightened it when she got older. Her hair is thick enough for her to keep objects like the family savings in it. Her hair is once shown close to her knees, consistent with the logic that a lot of hair would be needed to create her tall beehive. It was revealed by Homer that Marge dyes her hair with blue dye #56, stating ""She's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.""  Marge herself has made reference to blue not being her natural color, telling this once to the private camera on a reality TV show. Though, she obviously doesn't want anyone to know this as she instantly tried to steal the tape. Because of her unusually large hairstyle, her height is reported to be 8'6"", as noted by Apu, But is only about 5'4"" - 5'8"" without her hair. Her hair was blue before she met Homer and was brunette the first time she met and kissed Homer. He didn't see her in her usual appearance until they met in high school. This is due to Marge ironing a part of her hair for too long and it turning it brown, so she chose to do the same to the rest of her hair to keep it even. Apparently, to keep her hairstyle, she uses hair spray, moose, copper wire, Armor-All, and a cement gun that uses a form of concrete. In flashbacks when Bart and Lisa were born her beehive was shorter.
 In future appearances, she has the same hairstyle and clothing, except she has wrinkles on her mouth and eyes. In ""Holidays of Future Passed"" and ""Days of Future Future"", she does not have visible wrinkles on her face, her hair is a bit smaller and has gone grey, and her dress has a collar and a black belt around it.
 In ""Barthood"" and ""Mr. Lisa's Opus"", she is depicted in Bart and Lisa's preteen and late teen years with her grey roots, and she wears different clothes - two years in the future she wears a teal tank top and dark green skirt, and six years in the future she wears a long-sleeved purple shirt and tan jeans.
 Politically, Marge generally aligns with the Both Parties but since she ran for the Republican Party in ""The Old Blue Mayor She Ain't What She Used to Be"" she most likely is a Republican. And she once said that she voted for Ronald Reagan and also supported the candidacy of their state's progressive governor Mary Bailey who was never stated to be a Democrat or Republican or independent but is most likely a Democrat, and also claimed to have been extremely depressed when Lyndon B. Johnson passed away. She also ran once for the Republican Party during the mayoral elections, however, appears to be a Republican, unlike Lisa who's a liberal progressive Democrat.
 Marge's painting of Ringo Starr Marge is a very talented painter. When she was a teenager, she had an intense crush on Ringo Starr and painted a large number of portraits of him. She also wrote to Starr, but only received a reply 25 years later. After Homer discovered her old paintings, Lisa encouraged Marge to enroll in an art contest in which her portrait of a drunk Homer asleep on the couch won a local art competition. She was then hired by Mr. Burns to paint a portrait of the tycoon. After many attempts, she almost gave up until a belated response from Ringo Starr (stating that she had talent) inspired her to continue. The resulting portrait won even Mr. Burns' praise, a massive feat in itself, and was placed at the Springfield Art Museum's Burns Wing. In fact, she does show artistic prowess in other areas, such as being able to make life-size sculptures of many of her peers out of Popsicle sticks.
 Marge is also a very talented cook. She once opened up a pretzel business, but it flourished after fewer people came. She usually cooks the family's meals, but sometimes Homer cooks the family's meals, with Bart, Lisa, and Maggie sometimes cooking the meals. It is revealed in one episode, she entered a cooking contest during her high school years but made a few mistakes. She learned from them and became the family cook. Now with kids and a husband, she still demonstrates her ""chef-like skills"" and once made some amazingly delicious meals.
 Marge lifts and throws Homer out of the bedroom. Marge winning the second-place trophy at the Iron Maiden Fitness Pageant. Marge also occasionally displays superhuman strength. She has been seen lifting Homer off the ground easily several times, including picking him up and throwing him through the bedroom door to show him that Moe taught her the bum's rush and swinging him around in a circle during a dance contest; she also once effortlessly tossed a motorcycle to Homer up a flight of stairs. She also knocked Snake out with a garbage can lid.
 In ""The Old Blue Mayor She Ain't What She Used to Be"", Marge ran for Mayor of Springfield after being personally insulted by the incumbent Mayor Quimby at a public town hall meeting. After slowing gaining in polls, she narrowly won over Quimby in an upset. Admittedly uncertain of her skills, Marge proved to be a popular mayor after a very rocky first year. Marge had First Contact and was praised for her swift response to the Great Molasses Flood, contributing to her winning re-election in a landslide later that year. However, Marge was removed from office by Springfield's city council in the summer over several complicated scandals. Still, her achievements in office merited the constructed of the Marge Mayoral Museum, which opened eight years after her first election to mayor.
 
Marge has a talent for building statues with Popsicle Sticks.  The Simpsons' Christmas card. (Husband): Marge loves Homer a lot; especially after realizing that he was right for her. However, their relationship has been put through countless strains and tests in the series, such as Homer's accidental marriage with Amber and Marge's flirtation with Jacques. Homer and Marge have been divorced and remarried again a number of times. Having known Homer since high school, Marge knows his personalities and habits well. She is often frustrated by his lazy behavior and tendency to spend most of his time at the bar drinking. She is also aware of how selfish he can be. As a father, Marge knows that Homer loves their kids but is often upset at how he tends to be rather thoughtless in regards to being an actual father to them; such as hardly spending time with the kids or bothering to know their interests, using Lisa's talent to read people to win football bets, roping Bart into numerous situations, basically forgetting about Maggie on a daily basis, etc. These same flaws have extended to her as well as Marge has found herself a victim of Homer's carelessness and disrespect. During these times, Marge is not afraid to show how upset she is with Homer but often tends to settle for any type of amends he makes.
 (Son): Marge acknowledges that her ""special little guy"" is indeed a troublemaker and attention seeker but often tries to deny or find reason behind his actions. At numerous points, she has tried to use her motherly love to keep him from being bad but has gradually come to accept that there may not be anything she can do. She has, at different points, left him to care for himself which has caused him to seek her love and attention when he realizes he needs her support or doesn't want to upset her. When this occurs, Marge usually begins babying him and the cycle will begin again. While aware of her son's destructive behavior, Marge also knows that Bart has a sensitive and caring side and is usually moved to tears when he shows genuine care and concern for someone else or when fixing a situation he either caused or escalated.
 (Older daughter): Lisa and Marge generally seem to have a good relationship. Marge often gives Lisa advice about a variety of matters. Lisa and Marge often tend to side with each other especially when it comes to Homer's, and sometimes Bart's, foolish antics. Like Bart and Homer, Lisa and Marge fight as well, mainly when they have opposing views of a topic; one example being that Marge does not fully approve of Lisa being a vegetarian and had admitted to Becky that she sneaks meat substances into Lisa's food simply because she thinks it's a phase Lisa is going through. Despite their close relationship, Marge, like Homer, fails to understand Lisa when she explains her point of view in a more intellectual manner. Although aware of the bright future that Lisa could obtain thanks to her gifts, in the episode ""Lisa Simpsons, this isn't your life"" Marge became incredibly hurt and confused when she learned Lisa did not want to end up in the same position as Marge when she grew up. This has been shown in a variety of different time points when Marge assumes Lisa will have a life similar to hers only to learn Lisa will try to have something far different. Marge has also shown that she tends to keep Lisa from straying too far from her, such as when Lisa developed a crush on a boy and Marge did not like Lisa spending time away from her. Lisa's gifts have also caused Marge to question why Lisa has to be different from those around her. Still, she is very proud of Lisa's good heart as she makes better choices than her father and brother.
 Marge with Maggie (Baby daughter) Marge has mentioned of herself and Maggie sharing a bond. Marge is often shown to be the primary caretaker for Maggie and the one closest to her. Like with Lisa, Marge believes she knows her youngest daughter better than anyone and becomes annoyed when someone else proves otherwise, such as when Moe fixed Maggie's hair bow in the manner she likes and Marge showed clear annoyance.
 (Friend); It has often been hinted that Moe had a crush on Marge, such as when Moe had Homer and Marge's wedding album and he painted his head onto Homer's. Although she treats him well, it is obvious Marge doesn't return his feelings and sees him just as a family friend. That said, she does occasionally show concern for his well-being when it's obvious he's depressed or down on his luck.
 Marge has only been seen interacting with Bart's friendly rival, Nelson, on rare occasions, although they seem to have an awkward, yet at the same time, friendly relationship. Although the two do not interact much (if at all) in the earliest episodes, they do so more often in the later seasons of the series. In ""Bart the Mother"", Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from seeing Nelson, thinking he is a bad influence to them. However, in ""The Haw-Hawed Couple"", she forces Bart to attend Nelson's birthday party. Also, in ""Lisa Simpson, This Isn't Your Life"", Marge is glad to see Bart and Nelson once again. In ""Sleeping with the Enemy"", the two forms a mother-and-son-like bond, which ends up as short-lived, but Marge and Nelson remained friends.
 (Close Friend/Neighbor): While Ned and Marge are close friends, there have been instances that show they might be attracted to each other. In ""The Devil Wears Nada"", she suddenly gets aroused when she sees Ned's shirt wet, and they almost kiss twice. In one episode that shows a montage of characters future deaths, it shows that after Homer dies, she eventually got married to Ned (and then she dies sometime later). 
 Marge does not usually make friends because of the disasters of Homer, as seen in ""The Last of the Red Hat Mamas"", where she had to hide that she was part of the Cheery Red Tomatoes. Sometimes she finds herself in groups of women like Springfield Investorettes or Charity Chicks. Throughout the series, the most significant friend she has had was Ruth Powers for a short time. In ""Large Marge"", Manjula describes herself as Marge's best friend. In the past, Marge was part of the Cool Moms. Most recently, Marge has become friends with Waylon Smithers, even knitting a sweater with a picture of his face that says, ""Best Friend"".
 In ""How the Test Was Won"", after a series of dangerous events, Homer imagines Marge making out with Lindsey Naegle (which is seen in the non-canon template above).
 At age 45, in ""Future-Drama"" Marge leaves Homer after he blew the family savings on an underwater home. She then dates Krusty the Clown. Homer tries to win Marge's love back by beating him up and is beaten up himself. Marge then gets back together with Homer.
 ""Lisa's Wedding"" and ""Holidays of Future Passed"" depict Marge still happily married to Homer. 
 In ""Bart to the Future"", Marge and Homer search for Lincoln gold in the White House where Lisa works as the president of the United States.
 In ""Days of Future Future"", which is a sequel to ""Holidays of Future Passed"", over the course of thirty years Homer keeps dying and being cloned by Frink back to life, but he eventually cannot be cloned anymore and is now a disembodied head on a screen. Marge kicks Homer out to live with Bart. Later in the episode when Bart and Lisa are at Moe's lamenting about their marriages, Marge is revealed to be there too, and says she married their father because when you make a decision, you stick with it. Her own advice convinces her to go back to Homer. At the end of the episode their relationship is amended, and Homer is now in a sophisticated, C-3PO-esque robot body.
 At the end of ""Flanders' Ladder"", Marge remarries Ned at some point after Homer's death and dies peacefully at the age of 84.
 In ""The Old Blue Mayor She Ain't What She Used to Be"", in the year 2022 Marge and Homer walk through a hall dedicated to her political career. Marge suggests skipping one exhibit that they come near, but Homer points out they have to pass through it to get to the building's cafeteria. They then walk through the exhibit that revealed that she was impeached and Quimby was reinstated as the Mayor of Springfield.
 Marge is voiced by Julie Kavner, who became famous for her role on the TV series Rhoda.
 As with many Simpsons characters, Marge's age, which is confirmed to be the same as Homer's in the Season 17 episode ""Regarding Margie"" and again in the Season 25 episode ""The Winter of His Content"", changes to serve the story. She celebrates her 34th birthday in Season 1's ""Life on the Fast Lane"". In Season 10's ""The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace"", Marge gives Homer's age as 39, and by Season 19's ""That '90s Show"", they are both ""almost 40"".
 Matt Groening first conceived the Simpson family in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. He had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts and had intended to present his ""Life in Hell"" series. When he realized that animating ""Life in Hell"" would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening planned to go in another direction. He sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after various members of his own family, with Marge being the name of his mother. Marge then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons clan on April 19, 1987, in the Tracey Ullman short ""Good Night"".
 In The Simpsons Season Four DVD commentary, Matt Groening states that the original idea behind Marge's hair was to conceal large rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies.  It did, however, make it in The Simpsons Arcade Game.
 Julie Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing Marge in the episode ""I Married Marge"". In 2004, Kavner and Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer) won a Young Artist Award for ""Most Popular Mom and Dad in a TV Series"". For her performance in The Simpsons Movie, Kavner received a nomination for ""Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature"" at the 2007 Annie Awards, but lost to Ian Holm in Ratatouille. Kavner's emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she ""gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever"".
 Marge is featured in much Simpsons-related merchandise, including T-shirts, baseball caps, stickers, cardboard stand-ups, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons, dolls, posters, and figurines. She has appeared in all of The Simpsons video games, including The Simpsons Game. Besides the television series, Marge regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics. Marge also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.
 In October 2009, it was announced that Marge would be featured on the front cover of the November issue of Playboy. The edition was first published on October 16, 2009. The cover and a three-page picture spread, as well as a story inside entitled ""The Devil in Marge Simpson"", is a celebration of the 20th anniversary of The Simpsons but is also part of a plan to appeal to younger readers. Chief executive of Playboy Enterprises, Scott Flanders, has said that the cover and centerfold were ""somewhat tongue-in-cheek"".
 Marge wearing her glasses. Bunny ears? As one of the five major title characters of the series, Marge appears in almost every episode, as well as The Simpsons Movie. She had no lines in ""Krusty Gets Kancelled""

Bart Simpson,True,False,True,False,False,1,Castellaneta,3,"Bartholomew JoJo ""Bart"" Simpson (born April 1 ,1979 or February 23, 1979) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and ""potentially dangerous"" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed ""Cosmo"", after discovering a comet in ""Bart's Comet"". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as ""Critical Hit"", ""Simpsons Treasure Trove #11"", and ""Winter Wingding"". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.
 Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series, he has discovered a new comet which was named after him, and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.
 “Bart is the dangerous eldest child of Homer and Marge. He is sometimes called El Barto.”
 A young Bart In one episode, Homer and Marge conceived Bart in 1980 after watching The Empire Strikes Back at the cinema. Later on however, Bart and his younger sister Lisa were unfamiliar with 1990s culture.
 Being a beautiful boy, Bart is a self-proclaimed underachiever and prankster who is constantly in detention, and, in addition to his behavior, is easily distracted. He is the most misunderstood of the family (after Maggie, who currently can only speak a few words), constantly frustrated by the narrow-minded people of Springfield, who judge him merely by his thoughts and actions.
 Baby Bart His penchant for shocking people began before he was born, Bart ""mooned"" Dr. Hibbert while he performed a sonogram on Marge when she was pregnant with him, and moments after being born, he set Homer's tie-on fire, starting his life as a prankster (although Marge claimed that he could not have done it on purpose because he was only ten minutes old). Bart's first words were ""Ay Caramba"" after he walked in on Homer and Marge at a bad time.
 When Lisa was born, Bart got jealous of all the attention Lisa was getting sick and tried to make himself the center of attention. Bart eventually couldn’t take it anymore and told Lisa he was running away. Then, Lisa said her first word: “Bart!” Bart heard Lisa and realized how much she loved him, and realized he had to stay.
 Bart's interests include Krusty the Clown (he is ""Krusty Buddy"" number 16302), reading comic books (especially Radioactive Man), watching TV (especially The Krusty the Clown Show and The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show), terrorizing Lisa, playing video games, helping Lisa solve various problems (e.g. reuniting Krusty with his estranged Father), and pulling off various pranks, (such as mooning unsuspecting people, prank calling Moe at his tavern, and his patented spitting off an overpass). Bart also sprays graffiti under the alias 'El Barto', and regularly frequents the Kwik-E-Mart (for bubble gum and Squishees) and The Android's Dungeon. Yuma Hickman moved to Springfield when Marge was pregnant with Bart.
 Bart hinted that his favorite movies are Jaws and the Star Wars trilogy. His best friend is Milhouse Van Houten.
 In ""My Sister, My Sitter”, it is stated that Lisa is 2 years and 38 days younger than Bart. In ""Mr. Lisa's Opus"" and on the show's official Instagram account, Lisa's birthday is revealed to be on May 9, putting Bart's birthday on April 1. However, in ""Simpsorama"", Bart states that his birthday is on February 23rd.
 Bart's Catchphrase Bart blows a kiss Bart is a kindhearted, loyal and energetic, but sometimes very rowdy and mischievous boy.
 Bart is a notorious prankster at Springfield Elementary, and his pranks are often elaborately complex, but can lead to unfortunate consequences. Bart's overall intelligence, like his mother's, has been shown to fluctuate slightly over the course of the series. It has been shown anywhere from being just above his father's level, to being just below, or (on the rare occasion that he shows interest or is willing to pay attention) exceeding that of his sister. Despite his behavior, Bart is also extremely good at science, art and even sports like skateboarding. His actions and speech frequently show considerable mental agility, street-smarts, and understanding. When Bart became a hall monitor for Springfield Elementary, his grades went up, showing that he only struggles because he does not pay any attention. Bart has ADHD. This has been exaggerated to the point he is willing to do Algebra, so long as it is a distraction from his actual homework.
 Bart being sporty On the other hand, Bart often seems to have trouble understanding even the simplest concepts, such as the word ""irony,"" what the equator is and that the logo on his globe (""Rand McNally"") is not actually a country. It was also once implied that his mischievous behavior may have been a result of Marge accidentally ingesting a droplet of champagne while pregnant with him. Also, as an infant, one night he wandered into the master bedroom and witnessed Homer and Marge having sex with each other.
 A paranoid Bart, who is under the effects of Focusyn. Labeled as an ""underachiever"" by authority figures, Bart rides an academic roller coaster, his grades, running the Loop-the-Loop from ""F"" to ""D-"" and back again. But he can be ingenious when the chips are down—as long as his ingenuity is not applied to anything school-related. Once, he put in a passionate effort to actually study when he was faced with the prospect of repeating the fourth grade, only to score a 59; he broke down in tears and inadvertantly displayed applied knowledge while crying, barely passing. He once learned portions of the Talmud to help reunite his idol, Krusty the Clown, with his father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky. Once, after unleashing a surf wave across the school (damaging property but also saving Ned Flanders, who was on fire at the time), Bart was given an experimental drug for attention deficit disorder called Focusyn. Focusing his energy allowed Bart's intellectual potential to reach its maximum, even to the point where he was capable of tutoring a Navajo boy. Unfortunately, the drug also drove him paranoid as a side effect, and he started to believe that Major League Baseball was using satellites to spy on everyone in town. Marge and Homer became concerned for his erratic behavior and tried to take him off the drug, but the prospect of losing his intellectual edge over his enemies causes Bart to go berserk and sneak into Fort Fragg to steal one of its tanks. After blazing a path of destruction through the town, Bart uses the tank's cannon to shoot down an MLB satellite, thereby actually proving his suspicions to be correct.
 
Bart also displayed the ability to learn very quickly when he so desired, or in some cases subconsciously. In ""The Crepes of Wrath"" while on an exchange trip to France, Bart managed to learn French without even realizing it simply by being in the vicinity of Ugolin and Cesar, two men who regularly spoke French. Later, during ""Homer vs. Patty and Selma"", he showed considerable talent in ballet despite his initial hatred of it, which he did not realize until he attempted to take off his leotard. He has also managed to do this by choice such as in ""Blame It on Lisa"", wherein Bart learns fluent Spanish in less time on a plane to Brazil, only to be told by Marge that the Brazilians speak Portuguese.
 Bart prank call. His pranks can range from being relatively harmless to very cruel/destructive, depending on the characterization. He was also frequently a delinquent, getting into all sorts of trouble. It is implied that his exceptionally mischievous behavior (which Lisa once noted was borderline sociopathic) had its roots from when Marge accidentally ingested a drop of champagne (caused by then-Mayor Quimby breaking a champagne bottle on the newly christened battleship, the U.S.S. Float-and-shoot) while still pregnant with Bart, as well as out of some deep-down rage for being told that he'll be a failure as early as preschool (of which it once led to him developing suicidal thoughts severe enough to make an extremely graphic drawing of his own demise). However, he has put limits on the trouble he can cause; he won't lower himself as to stealing the school textbooks like Lisa did while he was the hall monitor.
 Bart helping a kid reach the water fountain, showcasing his loyal, kindhearted nature. Although he gets into trouble and is sometimes shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has on a few occasions, helped the love life of his school Principal and his teacher, despite the fact he often terrorizes them, and he often befriends lesser-known kids like Milhouse. One example of his quasi-sense of honor is when Bart stands up for Ralph Wiggum at the cost of peer popularity with the bullies. Bart's hidden integrity is also evidenced when he is dared to shoot a bird with a BB gun by Nelson. Instead of outright refusing the challenge, Bart instead tries to intentionally miss the bird. Unfortunately, Bart doesn't compensate for a crooked sight, and he accidentally kills the bird. He is visibly upset by this, snapping at Nelson when he calls him a ""cold-blooded killer"" and even goes so far as to try and mend his wrongs with a right by adopting the bird's nest. Bart also displays his sense of morality when he acts as a conscience for his peers several times throughout the series, such as when he tells Jessica Lovejoy that stealing from the church is wrong. He was once sent to a juvenile detention center when he played a serious prank involving faux wedding gifts and a fake wedding.
 Comic Book Guy banning Bart from his shop Bart also has legitimate guilt whenever he got either Mrs. Krabappel or Principal Skinner fired, especially if it was not his intention to do so, like in the former case where his and his classmates’ plan on getting her laid back by spiking her drink backfired when she ended up getting herself fired, and the latter case where his dog ended up in the ventilation shafts and got trapped along with Willie when he intended to use Santa's Little Helper for show and tell. He also sometimes gets into trouble even when he never actually did anything bad, or even when he actually did a good deed. A notable example of the former is when he was framed for a prank at a medieval festival held at school and was expelled for it (the actual culprit was Groundskeeper Willie) but he was welcomed back as an apology, and a notable example of the latter was when both he and Milhouse ended up permanently (at the time) banned by Comic Book Guy from the Androids Dungeon because Bart and Milhouse talked Mrs. Prince out of selling him rare and invaluable Star Wars memorabilia that belonged to Martin Prince for what was obviously a ripped off price.
 Stampy meets the Simpsons. Although Lisa is a vegetarian, Bart is the real animal lover in the family. He becomes extremely attached to animals that fall under his care and will, most of the time, save animals that he feels will be hurt or else will go to great lengths to protect them. Some of Bart's favorite pets include: his dog (and best friend) named Santa's Little Helper, a snake named Strangles, an elephant named Stampy, a racehorse named Duncan, a nest of bird-eating lizards named Chirpy Boy and Bart Junior, Santa's Little Helper's greyhound puppies and a cow named Lou, for whom he was willing to prematurely marry in order to spare from the slaughterhouse.

 Bart has had many relationships with girls and in the future marries and divorces Jenda. However, he has also been hinted as being attracted to boys. In ""Bart’s Friend Falls in Love"", Milhouse is smitten with a transfer student named Samantha Stankey; Bart schemes not to steal the girl but to detonate the affair so he can have Milhouse back. Whatever discomfort Bart evinces at Milhouse’s emotional attachment to him takes the familiar, unsubtle form of denial. And when Bart does find friendship with another boy, it’s expressly coded as romantic: ""The Haw-Hawed Couple"" of season 18 sees him growing close to class bully Nelson Muntz, only to wind up fearing the intensity of his devotion. In the end, Bart wistfully cradles one of his denim vests — an allusion to Brokeback Mountain.
 So it can either be down to Bart being possibly drawn to both genders or his emotionally sensitive side leads him to acting more emotionally closer with others in some circumstances, regardless of who.
 Bart has yellow skin and blond spiky hair (naturally pale red as revealed in ""No Loan Again, Naturally"") that matches the color of his skin (similar to his sisters - on one occasion, this caused distress in all three of the siblings and had them wonder where their heads end and their hair actually starts), sports, and, like the other characters of The Simpsons, has blue eyes (although the pupils look like 2 black dots). He wears an vermillion shirt (salmon in ""Bart Gets an ""F"""", blue short-sleeved shirt on early merchandise), blue shorts and blue sneakers with white socks. He sometimes wears his ""lucky"" red baseball cap and carries around his skateboard or a slingshot.
 In his future appearances, his hair is usually longer, and he is shown to be slightly fat.
 Bart as Bartman Bart sprays graffiti around Springfield using the name ""El Barto"", and his superhero alter-ego is 
""Bartman"". He called himself Cupcake Kid when Homer became Pie Man. Bart is also known as ""The Devil in Blue Shorts"" by the organizers of the Teacher of the Year Awards, but he was believed to be an urban legend.
 El Barto is what Bart calls himself. Principal Skinner considers El Barto the most wanted kid in the school. It is spotted in many episodes, usually where graffiti is normally. It also appeared on all four discs of the Complete Tenth Season DVD box-set during the 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment logo before the DVD menu. Here, Bart wrote El Barto on the 20th Century Fox structure just before a security guard catches Bart. When the security guard finally manages to catch Bart, he sprayed the spray paint into the guard's face.
 A family tree showing Bart's extended family and ancestry can be seen here.
 Homer angrily strangling Bart, in a vengeful way Due to Bart's mischievousness and rebelliousness in addition to Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the two have a turbulent relationship. Bart will often address Homer by his given name instead of ""Dad"" (when he was a baby, this was because other adults would refer to him as this), while Homer in turn often refers to him as ""the boy"". Usually, when Homer finds out that Bart has said or done something stupid or bad, he turns red and shouts ""Why you little!"" (often followed by throttling/strangling him) or simply ""BART!"" Bart once returned the favor when he learned that Homer, in order to buy back incriminating photos of him dropping Bart down as a baby, spent all the money that had been earned by starring in Baby-So-Fresh commercials relating to alleviating bad smells from babies, eventually resorting to using Homer's belt to strangle his larynx due to being unable to strangle Homer the usual way due to the size differences between the two, and directly led to a separation from his father.
 It is also implied once that, whenever he messes up, he almost expects people to strangle him and even goes as far as to strangle himself (presumably due to his experience with Homer), such as when he accidentally let go of Ned Flanders' best fishing rod when attempting to fish with Flanders, Bart instinctively starts clutching his own neck and imitating strangling before realizing and reacting with surprise that Ned Flanders isn't strangling him. Homer and Bart's relationship reaches a breaking point following Homer's pollution of Lake Springfield (causing Springfield to be sealed under a giant dome by the EPA), with Bart even going so far as saying that he wishes Flanders was his father. Even though at other times, Bart is shown bonding with his father, such as through coin collecting or selling grease. Bart has even danced opposite Homer when the latter became a popular mascot.
 Bart and Homer hugging at Springfield Gorge It is often suggested that Bart is at times hurt that he and his father are in opposition to each other. Homer, despite being under the influence of marijuana at the time, genuinely explains that it is because Bart's birth signified the end of his youthful foolishness, as he now had a family to provide for, which intimidated him. Also adding that he is very much like Bart, as like his son, he is greatly misunderstood and insecure about his place in the family. Nevertheless, the two really do love each other deep down.
 Bart spanked by George H.W. Bush Homer can also at times be protective of Bart. As when George Bush spanked him, Homer, in a rage, started a pranking war that led to a brutal fight against the former president. When Bart was trapped down a well, his father stopped at nothing to dig a hole to find and save him. In addition, Homer has also ""protected"" Bart from the horrible sight of his nude aunt Patty by bleaching his son's eyes. Bart questioned this only to discover that Homer was looking out for him and appreciated it. Also, when he took note of Bart's rather merciless mimicking of Abe's ""Gorgeous Godfrey"" persona on other children, Homer berated his father for this.
 Bart and Marge hugging Marge, who calls Bart her ""special little guy"", is much more caring, understanding and nurturing than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as ""a handful"" and is often embarrassed by his antics.
 Unlike with Homer and Lisa, Bart never goes out of his way to prank Marge, and feels very guilty whenever he upsets or hurts her in any way. Marge helps serve as Bart’s moral compass that keeps his behavior from drifting too far into worse territories. And she's most definitely the one where Bart got his empathy and sensitive side from. Marge trusts and has her belief in Bart being a good person despite his misbehavior, but this has been challenged such as when Bart stole a video game from the store and shot a bird (although she didn’t know he didn’t mean to, at the time).
 “I hate you.” Bart shares a sibling rivalry with Lisa, who is two years and thirty-eight days younger than he is. While Bart has often hurt Lisa out of jealousy, and even fought her physically, they are very close—he loves her as deeply as she does him, and has always apologized for going too far. Most of the time, when Bart takes charge of the children of Springfield, Lisa is shown as not only supportive but at times even stands by his side (along with Nelson and Milhouse). He is often shown to be very protective of her when she is threatened or insulted by others (even though he frequently insults her himself), evidenced by his willingness to fight Weasel for stealing and destroying her cupcakes and stand up to Nelson when he shoved her to get to Milhouse (even though Nelson assumed Bart would side with him). 
 Bart and Lisa working together Indeed, in ""Bart of Darkness"", Bart's love and protectiveness towards Lisa gave him the strength to work past his broken foot (the cast being caught in a trash can, stuck on a hose, attached to a dirt mound, and pulling the weight of a bicycle with a stubborn dog leashed onto it) in order to rescue his sister when under the belief that she was in danger of being killed by Ned Flanders. In addition, Bart has shown himself willing to put himself through labor, swallow his pride, and even purchase things for her, as when trying to make her feel better, he offered to make her bed, start a foundation for the animals she saved, and even spend money on a $500 record instead of a long-desired novelty. Bart has even sacrificed a dream job (Hall Monitor) and good grades to protect her from a damaging punishment caused by her own actions and helped her restore her reputation among the other children when she betrayed them by way of posing as a college student. Bart also seems to acknowledge Lisa as his better when it comes down to solving problems (even though he was instrumental in rescuing snakes on Whacking Day and retrieving his father's Hive grill) and frequently goes to her for advice. Both siblings formed a dynamic crime-solving duo during many of their encounters with Sideshow Bob, Bart's nemesis. At one time, he enters a series of robot battles with his robot: Chief Knock-a-Homer (which is Homer as the robot hoping to gain Bart's trust), and tries to cheer up Lisa when Snowball II dies. Also, in ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"" and ""Holidays of Future Passed, he tells Lisa that she's the person Bart has always wanted to be.
 Bart and Maggie bonding Arguably, Bart's best relationship with his family is with Maggie, as they more often than not get along quite well (mostly because she is a baby). Bart's shine to Maggie has come in the form of his pulling various pranks with her, playing and bonding with her after he and Milhouse were separated for a time, and at one point square-dancing with her at a Dude Ranch.
 Bart with Ralph Wiggum While being disliked by most adults, Bart is rather popular with other kids and has very many friends at his school. His closest friend is Milhouse Van Houten; Bart's other friends include Nelson Muntz, Lewis, Richard, Bashir bin Laden, Nikki McKenna, Jessica Lovejoy, Donny, Laura Powers and even the less socially desirable children of his school, such as Ralph Wiggum, Martin Prince, Database, and Wendell Borton.
 Bart and Milhouse going down an escalator in an inflatable raft, an example of the reckless activities Bart encourages Out of all of them, Bart's best friend is Milhouse Van Houten. Though the two are close friends, Bart has accidentally put Milhouse into trouble countless times throughout the series, with more than one occasion causing physical harm to Milhouse due to Bart's lack of regard for Milhouse's safety. At one time, Bart was driving a forklift with Milhouse standing on the fork while the forklift was moving. When Marge stopped Bart from driving the forklift, Milhouse was sent flying and was knocked unconscious.
 The relationship between Milhouse and Bart has been strained several times. When Milhouse fell in love with Samantha Stankey and spent less time with his best buddy, Bart separated the two by notifying Samantha's father, who placed Samantha in a Catholic school. This resulted in a fight between the two friends, although Bart eventually offered an apology. In one episode, Bart stated that he was a little attracted to Milhouse, to get Homer ticked off.
 Nelson and Bart do sometimes get along with each other. Bart's relationship with fellow school ne'er-do-gooder Nelson Muntz is rather rocky, even in recent times. Bart's first encounter with Nelson resulted in the bully recieving a bleeding nose in an act of self-defense; however, Nelson immediately took a dislike to Bart. An ensuing encounter resulted in Bart returning home all trashed up and in a trash can. Bart eventually rallied the kids of Springfield to fight back against Nelson and his cronies, which led to the bullies surrendering. 
 While he has bullied Bart in the same way he has bullied the other kids, Nelson does respect him and is regularly seen in Bart's circle of friends; this turns a heel in ""The Haw-Hawed Couple"", where they're forced to work together; despite a brief separation, they would reunite by the end.
 The show has suggested that their friendship could exceed that of Milhouse.
 Bart is understood to be a huge troublemaker at his school, resulting in him often being enemies of the teachers, particularly Edna Krabappel, Principal Seymour Skinner and Groundskeeper Willie. Despite this, while he does take joy in tormenting them, he does have some degree of respect for them, and would never deliberately intend to get them fired.
 During the 20th anniversary of Seymour Skinner's time as principal, Bart tried to prepare a meal for Skinner to honor him. Bart initially attempted to give him scoops of dog food with American flags sticking out of them (either as a prank or because, according to Bart, Skinner actually likes dog food), although a combination of factors, namely Marge suggesting he make a cake instead after initially telling him off, as well as Homer obliviously eating the dog food beforehand, Bart instead made Skinner a cake (although Homer ate it before ""Skinner"" had the chance to cut it after the unexpected arrival of the real Seymour Skinner while everyone was surprised at Skinner, or rather Armin Tamzarian's admission to being a fraud).
 While he believes in ""cooties"", Bart has had numerous relationships and crushes on a number of girls in town, despite that most of them had ended in breaking up. Of course while in these relationships, Bart gets into more trouble than he usually does by himself.
 
A teenager who Bart had a crush on, Laura Powers was the Simpsons' babysitter for Lisa, Bart, and Maggie. When Bart soon found out that Laura was going out with Jimbo Jones, he later prank-called Moe, under the name of Jimbo Jones, in order to expose him as the cowardly bully instead of the ""bad boy"" he claimed, all in front of Laura when Moe threatened him. Laura then said she would date Bart if he were older and kisses him, and made her first prank call to Moe, under the name of ""Ivana Tinkle"", with help from Bart.  Bart and Laura dancing. Jessica kisses Bart Jessica Lovejoy was Bart's first girlfriend. She liked Bart because of his bad-boy attitude and the fact that her parents didn't like him. Bart liked her because she was ""smart, beautiful, and a liar"". However, she ultimately turned out to be too bad for Bart and he chose to stay away from her, only to be sat next to her in church and framed for stealing by her. After all this, he initially pretends to still be attracted to her once she is revealed to be the true culprit and punished by scrubbing the church stairs, but once he takes over the job and Jessica leaves, he chuckles mischievously as he intends to do a poor job, hoping to get her in more trouble.
 In some Simpsons comics, they are shown to hang out with others such as when they, Nelson, Lisa and Ralph were dressed as ""Scooby-Doo"" characters and trying to solve a mystery, but they still show antagonism toward each other, making them at most frenemies with some infatuation with each other.
 Bart went out with a girl named Greta after he stopped some bullies from taking her backpack. She is the daughter of Rainier Wolfcastle. However, Bart later broke up with her. After the breakup, Greta went out with Milhouse Van Houten, with whom she then broke up with in Canada and stopped dating for four years.
 Bart and Gina In ""The Wandering Juvie"", Bart is arrested for pulling a prank, and he is sent to juvenile prison. Bart becomes very scared at the juvenile prison as the other juveniles are bigger and tougher than he is. One day at the jail, Bart nervously walks through the juvenile prison playground to see who he can hang out with and talk to, but everybody seemed violent. Bart then ends up at a fence that separates the boys from the girls, and Gina Vendetti tells him to get off of her fence and cuts off his juvenile prison uniform. Later that night, the juvenile prison held a dance for the boys and girls to get to know each other, and Bart is paired with Gina. Handcuffed, Gina forcefully pulls Bart to a nearby window, kisses him, and escapes, causing the police to search for them. Gina and Bart then stroll through the woods for a place to hide. The two end up at a blacksmith's shop, and they enter to get their handcuffs off. They kiss again, and they split up. Later, Bart finds Gina crying and she reveals that she doesn't have a family to return to, and then they are immediately caught by Chief Wiggum. The rest of the Simpson family comes to bid Bart farewell, but Gina admits to Chief Wiggum that the escape was her idea. Bart is free to go, but Gina must return. When Gina arrives at the juvenile prison, the Simpson family surprises her with a special taco dinner in her jail cell as a way of saying thanks for setting Bart free.
 Darcy is a 15-year-old girl who meets Bart when he gets a driver's license and uses it to pick up older girls. She was pregnant at the time and wanted her baby to have a father, so Darcy chose to get married to Bart when she fell in love with him. However, she didn't know that Bart was only 10 but still went to get married to him anyway as she was desperate for her baby to have a father. Their parents stop them before the marriage after Bart started to think that their relationship was becoming a little shaky, and they agree to meet again at some point.
 Bart &amp; Mary on the bench holding hands. Mary Spuckler is Bart's most prominent love interest, appearing in three episodes which is more than any of Bart's other love interests. In Apocalypse Cow, he was forced to marry her in order to save his cow Lou, but they ended up not getting married. She is one of Bart's girlfriends that return in Moonshine River, and they show interest again as she reveals to be a failing actress after running away. In the end, after Cletus finds out where Mary ran away to, he forces her to come back, but she runs away and kisses Bart, telling him he's great. She makes her current recent appearance in Love is a Many Splintered Thing, as she and Bart resume to date after her career failed. However, Bart paid very little attention to her, making her dump him for a Brazilian boy. It revealed that in the future she will marry the Brazilian boy, but when her status is revealed to be single on a website, Bart sends her a message.
 When both fourth-grade classes are merged, Bart is forced to sit next to Nikki McKenna, who at first seems annoyed with Bart. She soon warms up to him, and they become very close, until Bart kisses her, seemingly putting her off to him. After a no touching policy is imposed on the school, Nikki kisses Bart again, confusing Bart. This hot-then-cold relationship continues between them until Bart gets knocked out unconscious from falling off of the school roof. Nikki gives him CPR and mouth to mouth to resuscitate him, but then tells Bart that she'll never tell him why she was hot then cold.
 Bart's ex-girlfriend Jenny Jenny was a girl who helped out at the Springfield Retirement Castle at the same time Bart was forced to help out. Bart developed a crush on her and eventually, they entered a relationship with each other which was based on lies as Bart pretended to be totally different. Eventually, she found out what Bart was really like and dumped him.
 Melody Juniper was the daughter of Calliope Juniper, the new music teacher in school. Principal Skinner made Bart date her so that he could get a chance with Calliope. Melody was happy with this but Bart wasn't as happy. After Bart told her he wasn't happy with dating her, both Melody and her mother chose to move from Springfield.
 Bart's first kiss was from Becky when she was dared to kiss him while playing truth or dare with Lisa, Janey, White-Haired Girl, and Wanda. However, he has not been in a relationship with her and never seemed to want one.
 Although it has never been shown explicitly on the show, it has been implied that Bart dated one of the twins after Homer convinced her that she couldn't really do any better than Bart. Which twin Bart actually dated with was never clearly stated, but it is clear that Bart went to the school dance with either Sherri or Terri. It is also implied that one of the twins has a crush on Bart, but once again, it isn't stated who it was.
 Sherri and Terri introduced Bart to their 'boy-crazy' cousin and Bart immediately showed interest in her, so he invited her to play ""Spin the Bottle"" with the twins and Milhouse.
 The ""Summer Romance girl"" is a girl that Bart had a brief relationship on, as part of his list of things to do before summer holidays ended. It also turned out that Bart was part of HER list, being the 100th boy she kissed before summer ended.
 Shauna was Jimbo's girlfriend until Jimbo had Bart watch her so he can do the activities that don't interest Shauna. Shauna and Bart became closer when he stood up for her. They began to spend more time with each other as Jimbo trusted Bart with her. For saving Shauna from mall jail, she rewarded Bart by flashing her breasts to him. Bart told her to leave Jimbo because he didn't respect Shauna and from then on she dated Bart. Jimbo found them kissing and Bart was afraid of being beaten up by him. Lisa had Shauna leave Bart (as it was for the best) right after Jimbo found Bart and Shauna in the tree house. Shauna is Bart's only girlfriend to reveal anything private visually. They kissed again in ""What to Expect When Bart's Expecting"".
 Milhouse's teenage cousin, Annika forms a romantic relationship with Bart in ""Let's Go Fly a Coot"".
 Bob is Bart Simpson’s arch-enemy and most dangerous one as well. Ever since Bart exposed him for framing Krusty The Clown, Bob has developed an pure obsessive hatred for Bart and has vowed revenge against him since. He has attempted to kill the boy multiple times from sending him bloody mail, stalking him until the family are forced to go into witness protection, doing surgery to pretend to be another person to catch him off guard and more. But all these attempts would end in failure as Bart along with his family (mainly Lisa) would find a way to outsmart him and send him back to jail. A big part of why Bob hates Bart is down to his vanity &amp; pride as he is a man of high culture and intelligence, so it hurts him that his schemes are constantly foiled because of an underachieving-little boy. He also views Bart as the reason for his life being ruined, despite the fact that it was all a result of his own actions and he had allowed his obsession with Bart to run his life. He starts to realize this in the episode “Gone Boy”, where he seemingly gives up his desire for Bart’s blood (but that could be retconned if the writers choose). But in the same episode, it shows Bob in the future still struggling with these feelings, but tells the mailman to not waste &amp; ruin his life because of revenge. 
 Bob behind Bart Bart sees Bob as a threat and has shown great fear and even trauma as a result of his attempts on his life. To the point seeing him on TV causes Bart to run away screaming in fear. But despite his distaste for the man for his murder attempts on him &amp; his family, they’ve worked together on occasion like when Bob’s brother Cecil tried to blow up the town dam, leading to both Bart &amp; Bob saving each other on respectively. And Bart even showed some guilt towards Bob when he believes he killed Bob by accident in “Funeral For A Fiend”. But later seasons would show Bart being unafraid of Bob and not taking him seriously given his many foiled attempts against him. 
 Nelson was the first real antagonist to Bart early in the show’s life. Bart first met him after he was defending his sister from bullies and accidentally punched him in the nose. Doing that made Nelson beat up Bart any chance he got, leaving him hurt &amp; humiliated. Eventually with some advice from Homer &amp; help from his Grandpa, Bart rallied behind an army of kids to stand against Nelson, leading to his defeat. Nelson would stick as the ruthless delinquent rival to Bart for many episodes, with him being joined by the other bullies to mess with Bart &amp; the other kids. 
 Nelson glaring at Bart But in some episodes in the early seasons, show Nelson hanging out with Bart and the others like in “Bart On The Road” &amp; “Lemon Of Troy”. But Nelson &amp; Bart’s relationship would progress in “The Haw-Hawed Couple”, where after being forced to attend Nelson’s birthday, Bart sees that no one came and he would sympathize with him. This leads to the two playing together at the party and having fun. Nelson &amp; Bart would become friends with each other, with Nelson protecting him from other bullies. But this would falter as Nelson gets too clingy with Bart and Bart becomes bothered by his aggressive nature, and would try to avoid him. But by the end things sort of work out, and Nelson would remain a core part of Bart’s friend group, although he can go back to bullying Bart depending on the writer.  
 Some episodes suggest Bart’s friendship with him might be stronger than Milhouse, his long-time friend from Kindergarten. The future episodes show them keeping in touch as adults and Nelson helping him get a job when he has to pay alimony, while him &amp; Milhouse pretty much don’t hang out or talk seemingly. 
 Skinner is a direct opponent for Bart as he manages the Springfield Elementary and has to deal with Bart’s misbehaving antics on a regular basis. From him pulling pranks &amp; causing destruction, Skinner is always ready to put the boy in detention when he’s attempting to cause trouble. This is taken to great extremes in “The Boy Who Knew Too Much” where he goes on a manhunt for Bart when he tries to skip school, even walking through water to catch him.  
 But despite their opposition to each other, especially from Bart, there’s no real malice or hatred. Bart may be annoyed at Skinner’s rule bearing, he has shown sympathy &amp; concern for his principal. Like when he thought he got him murdered by the mob &amp; got him fired because of Santa’s Little Helper. Skinner and Bart would become friends when Skinner was fired, but they went back to their old routine once he was rehired, but they still act cool with each other when no one’s looking 
 Jack tries to burn Bart alive Jack was a harsh disciplinarian who had one appearance. In the episode, he would take joy in tormenting &amp; bullying rowdy kids like Bart rather than teach them to be better people. Bart would get the brunt of it with him shaving off his hair &amp; electrocuting the boy. Bart would get revenge on him by ruining his role in the Blazing Guy event. This would lead to Jack attempting to burn Bart alive. Homer manages to save Jack and he was apprehended, then fired from his role as a teacher. He would go on to work as a security guard in Springfield Prison where he would meet Sideshow Bob and learn how he hates Bart too. Jack suggests they could work together, but Bob refuses as he wants to kill Bart himself (which is unfortunate as it’s Kelsey Grammer &amp; Wilhem Dafoe).
 Bart is a polyglot and can speak several languages with varying degrees of fluency. Though he has not demonstrated the ability since his exchange trip to France as an exchange student (other than in the ""Butterfinger Group"" Simpsons Butterfinger commercial), he speaks near-perfect French. He also learned Spanish in a matter of hours in preparation for the family's trip to Brazil. Upon learning that Brazilians speak Portuguese and not Spanish, Homer orders his son to forget what he learned, prompting Bart to strike himself over the head until he forgot the language. Bart also speaks Japanese (which he also learned in a couple of hours in prison along with his father, Homer, who is also shown speaking Japanese), Cantonese and Latin. His advanced linguistic skills may be inherited from Homer, who also speaks advanced languages, including penguin.
 Another skill Bart inherited from Homer was his musical ability, he was shown to be a skilled drummer  at least until an injury destroyed this talent.
 Bart plays hockey He was a player in the Mighty Pigs Peewee Hockey League Team and their main scorer. He is also quite capable of firing advanced firearms with a frightening accuracy, as evidenced when, while at military school as a result of a prank involving electric mega horns, he was given an RGB6 Grenade Launcher by the firing range instructor due to his belief that Bart knew how to operate handguns, and he managed to destroy four out of five targets before one of his shots missed and ended up hitting Principal Skinner's car just as he was about to unlock it, to which Bart implied that he deliberately missed the fifth target and was actually aiming for Skinner's car that time. His killing teacher describes him as ""a natural"" in this same episode. He later displayed a similar proficiency towards weapons when he managed to hijack a tank by stealing the keys, drive it over to the park, and shoot down an MLB satellite with surprising accuracy all by himself, although at that point, he was also under the effects of an experimental drug that was supposed to suppress Bart's Attention Deficit Disorder.
 Bart can also drive vehicles with surprising skill for his age. He has his own drivers license, given to him after saving Springfield from a fire (shown in 'Little Big Girl'), although he has been seen driving before with a fake license at times. He still possesses it, using it to steal Principal Skinner's car to get to Jimbo's house.
 Bart is also a skilled chef. He cooked a three-course meal for his parents and made a dessert.
 When he was made hall monitor, he also had a great degree of skill in enforcing the law and rules. This trait was later exemplified when he, in a similar fashion to a bouncer, removed Homer from the premises of the La Maison Derrière after he continuously heckled Marge's ventriloquist performance.
 Additionally, Bart has a natural inclination to dance, and was a ballet star in his dance class for a brief period at school. Likely, he inherited this ability from his father, who had been a talented gymnast during his years in high school.
 Bart asserts control over Principal Skinner Although he frequently gets bad grades in school, Bart consistently shows levels of high intelligence with his witty social commentary and clever thinking. Bart's intelligence does fluctuate from episode to episode, however, as Lisa was able to prove that he was ""dumber than a hamster,"" yet he managed to outsmart her in that same episode with a similar project. In addition, Bart has consistently bested the genius of Sideshow Bob (figuring out his plan to kill Selma and tricking him by stalling just long enough to enable him to be arrested). While Lisa is more ""book smart"" and of superb literary intelligence, Bart is street smart and of remarkable social intelligence, as he naturally assumes the position of undisputed leader in any situation thrust upon him, such as when he led many children to the park to play when expressing his exasperation over being constantly followed by adults, when he led a pack of children to infiltrate Shelbyville in order to retrieve their stolen lemon tree
, or when he led his fellow campers in a takeover of Kamp Krusty. Bart has also shown considerable leadership prowess when he took charge of his fellow students (although only briefly) when they were stranded on an island, when he amassed an army of children to combat Nelson (ultimately managing to defeat him), led the takeover of Springfield Elementary during a snowstorm, when he orchestrated a curfew break and subsequent plot to expose the adults' secrets, and when he led a hostage-like situation as part of a plot to get Chalmers reinstated as superintendent. Bart's skill with people is also evidenced when Bart becomes the most successful news anchor on Kidz Newz, but in doing so steals the spotlight from Lisa. When Lisa voices her disapproval, it is explained to her that Bart was being promoted because he has ""zazz.""  It is implied in one episode that the reason he doesn't apply himself in his studies is that he does not wish to be like his sister.
 Bart is also highly skilled at manipulation and extortion. At one point, he successfully instigated a divide between Skinner and Krabappel in order to begin a Teacher's strike and extended the period by stirring up unrest at the local bank. He also at one point manipulated the townsfolk into controversy by spilling secrets of the adults over the radio and also manipulated his entire school into believing the myth of Dark Stanley (which, as it turns out, wasn't actually a myth). Other examples of manipulation was when he tricked many Springfieldians into coming to a phony wedding with gifts, when he attracted media attention by falsifying the concept of a boy being trapped in a well, and when he caused Homer to have a burst of anger in Boston over his refusal to wear a hat. Bart also has skill in extortion, as he managed to coerce his parents into doing whatever he wanted while pretending to be a sociopath and also extorted a U.S. Senator into following through with a key portion of a plan meant to get an air traffic bill passed. Bart has also extorted Skinner on a number of occasions, such as forcing him to do and say demeaning things via the threat of activating his peanut allergy and by making him either remain still or perform difficult tasks when he (Bart) and his fellow students took over the school.
 Bart is also very talented at craftsmanship. He once made a replica of himself to take his place in class and also one of Lisa so that he and the rest of his school could fool the state's comptroller.
 Bart golfing Bart has also demonstrated skill in regards to fighting prowess despite every now and then being beaten himself. At one point, after graduating from military school, he remarked that he is now a master of different forms of unarmed combat. He managed to hold his own in a fight with a girl highly-trained in Krav Maga and actually managed to get the better of Nelson on at least a couple of occasions (during a fight on the school playground and when he was working with his sister to stop the bullies from pulling a serious prank). At another instance, after challenging the fifth graders to a rumble, he easily caught a punch from the much-larger fifth-grade leader before noticing a scar on his hand. Though in a dream-like sequence and during a tree house of horror segment, Bart showed exceptional combat skill when he effortlessly pummeled 10 and 20-year-old versions of his father and when he easily overpowered an onslaught of Springfieldians while working for Moe as a secret agent. Bart has also shown rather admirable skill in armed combat, as he fought roughly on par with Skinner, a trained and experienced former Green Beret, in a stick fight that spilled throughout Springfield.
 Bart can also play a great game of putt-putt. He once almost won a miniature golf tournament against Todd Flanders. At the eighteenth hole, both boys decided the stress that each other's father was putting on them wasn't worth it and decided to take a tie and split the fifty-dollar prize. Other recreational activities in which he shows talent include skateboarding, jockeying, lassoing, and tennis.
 Bart also knows how to hot-wire a car.
 He also has the ability to find truffles by smell.
 Recently, Bart has demonstrated remarkable adeptness at chemistry.
 Bart is a very gifted kid and has proved that repeatedly, but the numerous factors such as feeling unsupported or being told he’ll just fail makes him not driven to harness these traits of his. Which helps lead into his destructive behavior and also plays a hand in the many bad futures for him that have been shown. Once someone gives him positive reinforcement and direction, he’s able to show himself to become exceptional.
 In Treehouse of Horror I, he was (formally) a raven.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror II"", the segment The Bart Zone Bart has the ability to bend reality with his mind and anyone who thinks badly of him will be turned into either a creature or object.
 In Treehouse of Horror VII, Bart learns that he has a stuck together (But not anymore) twin brother named Hugo.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror VIII"", during the segment Fly Vs. Fly he grabs a fly and uses Homer teleportation machine to splice his own DNA with the fly to become a fly superhero. However, it does not go as planned gets his head swapped with the fly instead.
 In Treehouse of Horror XIII, he was turned in a ""spider"" from Dr. Hibbert.
 At age 12, Bart has a mullet and gets in a foul mood because Lisa managed to overshadow him at his own birthday, so he decides to go out with Milhouse to break street lamps. Chief Wiggum arrests Milhouse and Bart manages to hide inside the retirement home where Grampa gives him a BMX. Bart has a mullet at school.
 At age 15, Bart can make some stunts on his bike. With Marge and Lisa at a camp and Homer at Moe's, he decides to throw a house party, where he finds Homer smoking cannabis. He gets angry at him and goes to Grampa's grave, where he gets the idea to enter a BMX Competition. He failed one of his stunts and blacked out, only to be rescued by Lisa, who was now a hero.
 At the age of 18, Bart is a senior at Springfield High School. He styles his hair and wears an earring. He speaks three languages, apparently, one being armpit noises, and one is hinted to be French. He pursues a relationship with a girl named Jenda. He's doing caricatures at a pier when he's invited to go to Milhouse's graduation party. There, Milhouse is humiliated by his parents but confronted by Lisa. Bart gets angry, as his sister can overshadow him even at his best friend's party. Lisa gets angry and confesses that she thinks he's a good artist, even though he doesn't do anything with his talent. Jenda who denies his proposal because he doesn't have a steady career plan. As a result, Bart pursues a career at the Kwik-E-Mart. Whether he kept the job is not mentioned. After saving Mr. Burns from a robbery, he is awarded a scholarship to Yale, which was meant to go to Lisa. He gives the scholarship back to her so she doesn't have to suffer a bleak future with Milhouse.
 At age 20, Bart takes his sister's advice and opens a bike customization shop, complete with a huge painting behind one of the doors dedicated to Lisa.
 At the age of 25, Bart became a building demolisher and vehicle crusher and plans to attend law school as soon as he ""gets all of  aggression out"". He also mentions having been divorced twice by this age. He is more kind in general, as opposed to his modern-day disposition.
 At age 40, Bart has two children, Picard Simpson and Kirk Simpson, who he barely ever sees. Jenda is now his ex-wife and has married her new boyfriend. His children have to stay with Bart for Christmas, which they think is going to suck. He eventually teaches them the meaning of Christmas, which schools aren't allowed to do in this time period. Bart's gained swag as a poor guitarist and alcoholic that dropped out of the DeVry Institute. He lives in a ratty beach house alongside Ralph, the only other member of Bart's band. At this age, Bart acts like an especially spoiled version of his ten-year-old self, still calling on his mother to make Lisa play fair when she does things like telling him he can't join the presidency (Lisa is the President of the United States at the time). He mooches money off his parents and Ned Flanders, to whom Bart regards as a ""softie"". His new catchphrase: ""You used to be cool, man."" He says this whenever he hears something he doesn't like from someone. Bart continuously embarrasses Lisa and unwittingly ruins her tax plan to get out of debt. Surprisingly, Lisa is much more embarrassed of Bart than of Homer in this episode. In the end, however, Bart's extensive experience with evading debt collectors leads to him helping Lisa buy some time to pay off America's debt to other countries. In gratitude, Lisa legalizes ""it"", ""it"" likely being the use of cannabis.
 At age 41, Bart is working at Cretaceous Park and is sad that his love with Jenda hasn't worked as expected and now he misses his kids. Nelson tries to convince him to be happy as he's a free man and dragged him to a party, where he's asked to leave. He then finds a brainwash clinic that helps him forget about Jenda. He manages to find other girlfriends, but he still misses Jenda. He later learns that her alien boyfriend, Jerry, has abandoned her. After a talk with Bart, she realizes that he's much more mature and decides to get back with him. As their second relationship wasn't working out either, they decide to break up again. He then wakes up at the clinic's chair and discovers that it was all a dream.
 At age 50, Bart appears to have straightened up and graduated law school, as he is Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Marge has also imagined Bart being a sleazy male stripper at this time.
 At the age of 70, he lives at the Springfield Retirement Castle with Milhouse.
 At the age of 80, he launches fireworks reading ""Skinner Sucks"", making Skinner suffer a fatal heart attack. His corpse would run him over, killing Bart.
 At the age of 83, he finds true love. Sadly, he dies one minute later after being ran over by Seymour Skinner's wheelchair.
 At age 40, he is taken to the hospital after eating too many fish logs. He seems to have lost his building demolishing company and works at a construction site. He got the ""Mother"" tattoo which Marge prevented him from getting, as well as a tattoo of Krusty the Clown on his chest. He receives a digestive tract transplant from Üter Zörker which saves his life. In ""Bart Gets an ""F"""" where Bart never passes the fourth grade, he has a wife and is in the same class as his son. An elderly Edna Krabappel asks the middle-aged Bart Sr. for the name of the pirate in Treasure Island. When he can't come up with the name, Bart Jr. tells him it's Long John Silver. Mrs. Krabappel then punishes both of them by giving them detention.
 In ""Hail to the Teeth"", Bart has an app which shows what people would look like at puberty, it shows Bart looking extremely good but dying at 17.
 Matt Groening first conceived the Simpson family in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. He had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts and had intended to present his Life in Hell series. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would force him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction. He hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, and named the characters after various members of his own family, substituting ""Bart"" for his own name, as he decided it would have been too obvious for him to have named the character Matt. Bart then made his debut with the rest of the Simpsons clan on April 19, 1987, in the Tracey Ullman short ""Good Night"". The name ""Bart"" is an anagram of the word ""brat"". Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the negative traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart. Groening has also said that he found the premise of Dennis the Menace disappointing and was inspired to create a character who was actually a menace.
 Nancy Cartwright originally auditioned for the role of Lisa, but soon thought that her voice would be better suited voicing Bart. Matt Groening let her try out for the part, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.
Bart's catchphrase ""Eat My Shorts"" was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was at college. His other catchphrases included ""¡Ay, caramba!"" and ""Don't have a cow man!"" - the former being his first words after seeing Homer and Marge 'enjoying themselves' in bed - but these dropped out of use as the series progressed (as mentioned in ""Summer of 4 Ft. 2"", when Bart complains that Lisa stole his line). Whenever he introduces himself, he often says, ""I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?""
 In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century — the only fictional character to make the list. He had previously appeared on the cover the December 31, 1990 edition. Both Bart and Lisa ranked #11 in TV Guide's ""Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time"".
 During the show's early years, Bart was rebellious and frequently escaped without punishment, which led some parents' groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H. W. Bush to rally, ""We're going to keep trying to strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons."", to which Bart replied with ""Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.""
 Bart's catchphrases, ""¡Ay, caramba!"", ""Don't have a cow, man!"" and ""Eat my shorts!"" were featured on t-shirts in the early days of the show's run. The latter two phrases were rarely actually spoken on the show itself until after they became popular through merchandise, and the use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The use of catchphrase-based humor was mocked in the episode ""Bart Gets Famous"" in which Bart gets famous on The Krusty the Clown Show for saying the line ""I didn't do it.""
 In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist. Bart's character traits of rebelliousness and disrespect for authority have been likened to that of America's founding fathers, rendering him an updated version of American icons Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, rolled into one.
 Bart is the most depicted Simpsons character on various memorabilia such as toys, books, comics, T-shirts, car decals, and even graffiti art. Bart and other Simpsons characters appeared in numerous commercials for Butterfinger candy bars from 1990–2001, with the slogan ""Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!"". This association was parodied when he discovered that he was in a Baby-So-Fresh TV commercial when he was a baby; Bart says that he doesn't remember being in a commercial, then holds up a Butterfinger and eats it. Bart briefly appears in the entrance video used by World Wrestling Entertainment Superstar Shawn Michaels Bart has appeared in several other shows. He is featured in the South Park episode ""Cartoon Wars Part II"". He is not referred to by name, nor do any of the characters react to him as if he were a well-known personality, but the character specifically mentions the events of ""The Telltale Head"" when Eric Cartman asks him to name the ""most bad-ass thing"" he has done.
 ""TV Guide"" listed Bart and Lisa as the 11th greatest cartoon characters of all time in their 2002 magazine issue listing the "" TV Guide's 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of all time"". With their father Homer making it all the way to the number two spot.
 Interestingly, Bart's catchphrases ""¡Ay, caramba!"" and ""Eat my shorts!"" are translated to ""E che cacchio"" (""What the hell"") and ""Ciucciati il calzino"" (""Suck my sock"") respectively.

 As one of the five major title characters of the series, Bart appears in almost every episode, as well as The Simpsons Movie. He does not appear and is not mentioned in ""Four Great Women and a Manicure and ""Carl Carlson Rides Again"". He had no lines in ""My Fare Lady"" and ""The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby,"" and had only one line in ""Eeny Teeny Maya, Moe"" and ""Moho House"".

Lisa Simpson,False,True,True,False,True,1,Smith,4,"Lisa Flanders Moaning LisaQueen HelveticaNancy CluelessMary-Anne Snickerpuss SimpsonSpringfield's Answer to a Question No One Asked (By Ned Flanders)Lois SanbornH.S.H/Her Serene HighnessThe Princess LisaPrincess of SpringfieldBaroness SimpsonWindsongJules Former: Babysitter Founder of SpringFace Kids News anchor Lisa Marie Simpson is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons. She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. In ""Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words"", she called herself Lisa Bouvier after estranging herself from her father after he bet against her in a crossword tournament. 
 Lisa Simpson is a charismatic 8-year-old girl who made her debut on December 17, 1989 from Season 1 through Season 3, Episode 1 (September 19, 1991) when she turns 8 years old for the duration of the series. From Season 3 onwards she is a 8-year-old girl who exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out at those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealousy from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent and rational one who usually thinks things through.
 Younger Lisa In one episode, Lisa was conceived in 1983 and born either during the 1984 Summer Olympics or the day the ""Where's the beef?"" debate between Walter Mondale and Gary Hart was reported in the newspapers. Later on however, Lisa and her older brother Bart were unfamiliar with 1990s culture. Bart said he was 2 years and 38 days older than Lisa.
 Lisa is quite eclectic in her knowledge and is notably more concerned with world affairs and problems than her cohorts, which has led her to alienate herself from her peers. Lisa also deeply values her integrity, sometimes at the expense of others' needs and happiness, as demonstrated when she cheats on a test in The Wind in the Willows to attain her highest grade of A-plus, but later admits her dishonesty to an unreceptive Principal Seymour Skinner despite the fact that such a grade allowed the school to gain the extra income it 'desperately' needs. (She later regrades the test as an F.) Also, Lisa was willing to tell everyone about Bart faking his own kidnapping to go to a rap concert (despite the fact that absolutely everybody involved in the case was better off) just because she could. 
 Despite her intellect, Lisa has received detention, like her brother Bart, quite a number of times, often because of her rebellious and sometimes bitter attitude and antisocial behavior that is capable of deeply embarrassing authority figures. Although her rebellion against social norms is usually constructive, Lisa can be crazy, cruel, and rebellious at times. When she believes herself to be right, she won't admit that others could be as well and will often force her beliefs onto people. Notably, her increasing sense of moral righteousness regarding her vegetarianism leads her to proselytize, culminating in her spiteful disruption of a ""meat-based"" barbecue prepared by Homer (an act she comes to rue). At times, Lisa appears to resist certain situations merely for the sake of resisting them, not because of any genuine ideological opposition. She appears to enjoy breaking the norm for its own sake; at one time, she triumphantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. When it is revealed that there are already girls on the team, she declares her distaste for a sport that would use a pig's skin to make its ball. When it is revealed that the ball is actually synthetic and the proceeds of buying it go in part to charity, she is at a loss for words and runs off visibly upset. She also seems to dislike having her intellect challenged, which is evident on occasions such as when she was temporarily promoted to the third grade or when Miss Hoover gave her a B+ on her final grade for conduct and actually caused her physical harm because of it. Lisa's first word was Bart. 
 Despite her high IQ, cuteness, and beauty, Lisa does have typical childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. She once tricked Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost when she mistakenly took a wrong bus. After his coworkers Lenny and Carl point out that he allowed his young daughter to ride a bus by herself, Homer comes to her rescue. Lisa has a Jewish imaginary friend named Rachel Cohen who ""just got into Brandeis University."" Even with a high intellect, Lisa displays personality traits typical for her age, including obsessing over getting a pony, being addicted to TV, and fighting with Bart. Lisa once got addicted to secondhand smoke to maintain an impressive level of ballet competence; Homer tries to prevent the addiction unsuccessfully, and in the end, Lisa overcomes the addiction herself through means of ""Hello Kitty"" nicotine patches. She also displays a surprising amount of skill in driving, especially for her age, sometimes even taking the wheel whenever Homer ended up distracted from driving.
 In ""The Girl Who Slept Too Little"", she struggled with nightmares after a cemetery was moved next to the Simpsons' house. She overcame her fear after spending a night in the cemetery and realized that it was acceptable to suffer from fear despite her intelligence. It was revealed in this episode that Lisa largely had to raise herself due to Homer and Marge dealing with Bart's antics thus ensuring a lack of nurturing for her. Lisa has been known in earlier seasons to have a bit of a sassy attitude. 
 Lisa is a heavy supporter of animal rights and often tries to prevent any kind of animal abuse she learns of. However, most likely because of her young age, she typically sides with cuter animals that are often seen as harmless and innocent, such as bunnies and whales. It wasn't until ""The Squirt and the Whale"" where Lisa realized other activists were right in that ""Being a true eco-activist means supporting every animals struggle for life."" She finally accepted that she could not support one side if it meant damage to the other side.
 Like Bart and most siblings in families, Lisa has been known to tease Bart herself, examples such as crushes Bart has developed, or advice on writing to someone (in this one case, his teacher), even just plain sassing him for attention. Deep down inside, Lisa loves her brother deeply.
 Lisa with a normal haircut in ""22 Short Films About Springfield"" Lisa has yellow skin, blue eyes (although the pupils look like 2 black dots just like the other characters), and a blonde ""starfish"" hairstyle that is styled into points and matches the color of her skin. She doesn’t have any visible hairline. She’s usually seen wearing a short, strapless orange dress with a zigzag hem, matching orange Mary-Jane shoes, and a white pearl necklace (given to her by Marge). She’s 4'2"" tall.
 She has had two different outfits for church and family outings: a magenta long-sleeved dress with a ruffled collar and magenta pumps for church and a baby pink short-sleeved tutu dress with a darker pink belt, dark pink collar, and pink Mary-Jane shoes; and she occasionally wears a matching wide-brimmed hat. At night, she dresses in a turquoise nightgown with a frilly white collar and matching cuffs, as well as turquoise slippers; and in ""Podcast News"", she wears lilac footie pajamas with gray pads on the bottom of the feet. When Lisa swims, she wears a magenta or red swimsuit.
 Her hair has been styled out of its star shape a few times, such as in 4 episodes ""The President Wore Pearls"", ""22 Short Films About Springfield "", ""Teenage Mutant Milk-caused Hurdles "", and ""Last Traction Hero"". It is also shown to be about chin or sometimes shoulder length. In future appearances as an adult and teenager, her hair ""points"" are usually worn in a styled-back fashion.
 Lisa inherited her father's chubby fingers, which somewhat affects her dexterity. She seems to be self-conscious about her body; if what has been said in several episodes is to be believed, she has a very fat posterior, with several characters in a few episodes making fun of how fat it is, most notably in ""Lisa's Date with Density"", ""Old Yeller-Belly"", ""The President Wore Pearls"", ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" and ""Lisa's Belly"".
 Female hero Lisa is an innovative, insightful, a sometimes girly, cute and extremely intelligent girl, far exceeding the standards of a second grader especially in Springfield. Part of her intelligence is due to being so dissociated from her idiotic father whilst growing up and it was strongly implied that her brains were a result of her grandmother; Homer could never keep up with his daughter's startling intelligence due to his slow wit and stupidly, his laziness and their contradicting vices and opinions caused a strained relationship and she practically grew up without a father figure, specifically not a model one (although Homer probably wouldn't have been much help even if he was involved in Lisa's life). As intelligent as she is, her family never encouraged her gifts, and her school lacked the resources to blossom her IQ further but overall, Lisa has the most promising future. Since she was a baby, Lisa has displayed intellectual independence from changing her own diapers and solving mathematical solutions when she was only an infant. She could be classified as a child prodigy.
 Her overall role in the Simpson family is depicted as the voice of reason. Despite her young age, Lisa is a good girl and has a strong sense of right, wrong, and morality; and she is always there to contradict Homer, Bart and on one occasion Marge whenever they do something reckless, idiotic or illegal, doing her very best to sway them to the path of the righteous due to fearing greatly for her father and brother's immortal soul but her standing as an outsider in her own family cause her to be ignored despite her best intentions. In an argument, Lisa's ethical and logical viewpoint almost always gives her the moral high ground, her family also realizes that Lisa is usually right whenever they do something immoral but Homer's tendency to ignore her, uses the excuse of age to send her to her room when they realize that they are in the wrong. In earlier seasons, however, Lisa has been depicted as intelligent yet not as mature due to her squabbling and physical fights with Bart, but she has developed into a more practical being yet her young age also makes her sense of right and wrong slightly malleable at times as she has shown to engage in childish and reckless behavior, proving herself to be like any other Simpson but more grounded and mature. Despite her above-average intelligence, she displays tendencies average for kids her age, such as obsessing over celebrities and playing with dolls.
 Lisa the vegetarian Despite her young age, Lisa is extremely passionate about ideologies and other social movements. She has been shown to support PETA (although she has eaten eggs and dairy) and the Free Tibetan movement, is highly against animal cruelty and has adopted a diet of vegetarianism from Season 7; she would later on become a full-on vegan, though this has shown to be more of an occasional feature rather than a permanent one. She encourages the idea of feminism, women's rights, and the crusade against objectification and stereotypes of women. Lisa's role models and ideals are based on Mohandas Gandhi's enforcement of nonviolent pacifism and Emmeline Pankhurst. 
 While her social movements are generally considered to be heroic, Lisa's reasoning is not solely to make the world a better place. A life of being shunned and ignored by her family has developed attention-seeking traits and a desire to be heard, once going to a dig site solely for the basis to complain about it, an area where she is usually ignored further. She used to force her beliefs on others due to a sense of self-righteousness and moral superiority, specifically her vegetarianism, but Apu also taught her a degree of tolerance for others' beliefs. Lisa is against ignorance on others' behalf, believing the truth is the truth and is unable to be dissuaded no matter what it was, which she learned from Marge. Without anyone else caring she continued to pester that the town founder, Jebediah Springfield was in actuality a murderous pirate and only refrained herself from revealing the truth when she realized how it brought the town together. 
 At her school, Lisa is considered to be a nerd because of her bookish and quiet nature. A teacher's pet and proud of it, she’s depicted as an introvert with few friends and those she does have are as much as a nerd as she is. Her lack of popularity is generally purposeful yet her lack of social skills and different hobbies to what is considered fun to the rest of the girls leads her to want more friends. On one example she changed her personality to fit a more rebellious nature like Bart and actually gained an entourage of friends at the Flanders beach house but when her true academic nature was revealed, they continued to befriend her due to viewing her as a kind, gentle person rather than just a nerd. Lisa has had a few boyfriends, though all of them were brief, despite her status as a geek such as Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum and Colin.
 Lisa breathing in the smoke Lisa's nicotine patches Extremely nonathletic, she fails at sports completely, and her liberal stance and high intelligence gives her little bonding ground with her peers and Homer who is also passionate about sports and connects with Bart more for this reason. Lisa is so weak that she could barely through a piece of paper into a rubbish can that was one away. However, she also displayed an uncharacteristic level of hand-eye coordination when she caught an incoming hockey puck from Apu and proved herself to be an extreme hockey player when she was a goalie. This non-athleticness is further shown when she joins a ballet team where the other members of the team have a smoking addiction. Initially, Lisa denounces them, claiming to not be allowed to smoke. She then begins to inhale second-hand smoke, before eventually becoming addicted to cigarettes. The episode ends with her addicted to nicotine. Even showing her nicotine patches in the last few seconds. This implies that she never actually got help with her addiction and continues to be an addict. However, most likely, as it is never further mentioned, that she is still addicted. The nicotine patches were never shown again.
 Similar to Bart, Lisa's high academic intelligence and her desire to go far in life is greatly driven by her future goals. Bart never focused on his book work as he and basically everyone else knew that he would amount to very little when he grew up whereas this is the opposite for Lisa who saw the potential in her life to achieve fantastic goals. When her career aptitude test came back that she would likely become a housewife when she grew up and her music teacher told her she could never achieve her dream of a jazz musician on account of ""stubby fingers"", crushed her dreams. After this, the quality of Lisa's work and behavior declined drastically as Bart's improved exponentially after his career aptitude came back that he would become a police officer, such as refusing to go to band practice, encouraging the bad girls to deface Skinner's puma statue and being rude to her teachers. She went as far to steal everybody's Teacher's Editions, a line that even Bart Simpson would not cross. Lisa would have undoubtedly become an even worse rebel than that of her brother if Bart hadn’t taken the blame for her crime. That said the prospect of a dull future also encourages Lisa to study further rather than immediately omit defeat as she did her very best to not become a housewife like Marge when their paths became very similar.
 Overall, though, Lisa's tendency to lash out towards her family is based on the beliefs that they don't understand her rather than actual spite. This proves to be true as jazz is the only thing that expresses her inner thoughts and how she is feeling whilst her family only silence her creativity further due to their great annoyance with her saxophone. She often embraces relationships with other paternal figures that encourage her to embrace her passions to fill the void that her real lazy and uninterested father left. When she became depressed in the second season and none of her family seemed to understand the reason behind this, opened up more to the troubled jazz musician, Bleeding Gums Murphy who told her to sing what she felt helped her emotional state greatly. She became deeply close to her substitute teacher, Mister Bergstrom, who again noticed and encouraged her intelligence to blossom. Over time, Lisa, although embarrassed by her family, is no longer ashamed to be a Simpson.
 One of her negative traits would be her penchant for narcissism. In one of her daydreams, she envisioned herself as bringing about world peace and being revered by world-famous scientists, chanting in her presence ""we're not worthy"". She prides herself on her intelligence and integrity but if her ego is at risk, displays a willingness to breach her morals such as sabotaging her rival Alison's diorama at the school fair, humiliating her in front of her peers. Even so, Lisa's conscience is too strong to commit an unethical act and not punish herself such as giving herself an F for her test which she cheated in and apologizing to Alison for her act of sabotage.
 She’s one of the few characters in Springfield who doesn’t have a signature trademark or catchphrase, shown specifically at the end of ""Bart Gets Famous"" when Marge, Bart, Homer, Nelson, Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns and Barney all do their trademark catchphrases, waiting for her to do anything, Lisa dryly replies ""if anyone needs me, I'll be in my room"", leading Homer to ask, ""what kind of catchphrase is that?""
 It’s mentioned that Lisa has an IQ of 159. She’s a high-ranking member of Mensa Springfield as well as being the youngest member. Lisa demonstrates an early intelligence by changing her own diaper as an infant and knowing advanced words to describe things. Because she is aware of how smart she is, Lisa often voices her disapproval of not being in a better school that could nurture her gifts and provide a better future for her. 
 Lisa's intelligence lends itself to many of the situations the family faces, be it financial or chaotic shenanigans. Like the rest of her paternal family, she can pick up a new language fairly quickly, she was able to learn fluent Italian from Milhouse in a fairly short amount of time.
 Unfortunately, Lisa has a tendency to act in a know-it-all manner which can make her somewhat smug at times and tries to push her knowledge/personal beliefs onto others. Another downside of her intellect is assuming things will work out how she hopes/daydreams, such as believing a romantic relationship will turn out happily after making her own assumptions or thinking her projects and schoolwork will automatically be the top rank of the class. Because of this, if she receives any grade under an A/A+ she will often spiral into a frenzy wondering why she did not score higher and/or will judge others around her if they happen to score better than her or accuse the person who graded/judged her of not understanding her work properly or playing favorites. Because she is usually one of, if not the, top students in the school, she is used to being the best academically and often cannot stand or feels threatened when someone is able to rival her. When this happens, Lisa will often push herself to great lengths and stress to maintain her status as the top student, even going so far as to sabotage others' work so she will stay number one.
 Lisa's political convictions are generally leftist and rather liberal. She is a vegetarian and a supporter of the Free Tibet movement. Lisa yells ""Free Tibet!"" after winning the school spelling bee. An ""End Apartheid"" poster can be seen in her bedroom in episodes from the early 1990s. She, like her mother, supported Democrat Mary Bailey over Right-Winged Mr. Burns; the duo revealed that Mr. Burns was a liar and Mary Bailey wins in a landslide, the only known supporters being Waylon Smithers, Bart, and Homer. While still supportive of the Christian church she was raised in, Lisa is now a practicing Buddhist following her decision to follow the Noble Eightfold Path. Though apparently not an adherent, she mentions that she considers Wicca ""very empowering"". She also appears to be a big believer in science, even stating in one episode when she was scared of the graveyard outside her bedroom, that she only believed in science. Lisa is also a big believer of women's rights and has called herself a feminist.
 When the family had taken a trip to a young children's fairytale land and visited the petting zoo, Lisa became so enamored with a highly adorable lamb that she became a devout vegetarian that same night. Because of her sudden change, she struggled with the change at first and nearly reverted back to eating meat after a few days but received support from Paul McCartney to stay a vegetarian. Coupled with her goal of ending animal cruelty, Lisa firmly sticks to the vegetarian lifestyle, but it did present drawbacks when she began suffering low iron levels and is implied to have been eating meat in her sleep. Despite going vegetarian for good intentions, this decision is not very accepted by her family, most notably Marge who had admitted to Becky that she slips meat juices into Lisa's food and wanted to blame the vegetarian diet for Lisa's iron deficiency.
 Lisa's musical abilities are extensive, she sings with a powerful voice (she once entered a singing competition and won) and has been seen playing the acoustic six-string, electric bass guitar, accordion and piano proficiently. But her great love is playing jazz on her baritone saxophone. Her musical inclinations were nurtured by her relationship with the late jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy. She most likely inherited her musical ability from Homer, who is also musically inclined. She can also play the trumpet in some intros as well as violin, tuba, and French horn.Similar to her academics, Lisa sees herself as the top musician in the school. She often tries to get others interested in jazz music but is often turned down. While she is often welcoming new sax players to the school band, she will become jealous and cold when discovering they are better than her.
 As the middle child and brainy student, Lisa often shows jealousy and anger when she does not receive enough attention from her parents or the school faculty. Because Bart and Maggie often draw more of their parents' attention and she is well behaved and more mature than her siblings, Lisa usually does not get much of their one-on-one attention and this has been one of her greater jealousy points.
 Other areas she becomes jealous of in are school and music. Because Lisa takes great pride in being the best when it comes to schoolwork and playing the sax, she usually becomes incredibly competitive and angry if a rival is able to match or outdo her in areas, she excels in despite many claims of needing a challenge or someone to relate to with the same issues. As she is not used to being the second best, her jealousy can at times make her act out in troublesome ways.
 She is fluent in Italian (learned from Milhouse Van Houten before going to Italy), as well as some French and German verbs (with the help of a German verb wheel ), as well as Spanish. In ""The Great Simpsina"" she studied under the great Raymondo to become a skilled magician.
 Lisa attends Springfield Elementary School alongside students such as Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, and alongside other gifted pupils, like Martin Prince and Database, she is one of the most academically advanced students at the school, and is often praised by staff members for her achievements yet at the same time is so successful that her accomplishments no longer surprise or inspire anyone. She is normally well-behaved; however, despite this, she has received detention a few times: Elizabeth Hoover in Sorry Not Sorry, from Dewey Largo and an unnamed teacher (in ""Grift of the Magi"" and ""Lisa's Date with Density"", respectively).
 Despite her stance as a good-natured girl, Lisa has indeed committed some crimes.
 Lisa has a somewhat labored relationship with Homer. Like many others, Lisa knows Homer and his behavior well. She can often tell when he has ulterior motives or is doing something that will mainly benefit himself. She has expressed hurt when he does not show genuine interest in spending time with either herself, her siblings, or Marge, and is very concerned about how much fatty food he eats and high consumption of alcohol. During the times they are able to truly connect, Lisa and Homer work well together and stick up for one another. Even knowing Homer's flaws, Lisa does love Homer.
 Lisa and her mother Marge generally get along well, with both being logical and wise women to a more impulsive and short-tempered man (Bart and Homer, respectively), although there have been moments of friction between the two. When Lisa decides to become a vegetarian, Marge, along with the rest of the family, makes fun of her by, unintentionally, participating in a conga line with Bart and Homer chanting ""You don't make friends with salad!"". During the moments when Lisa had several permanent changes, such as religion and vegetarianism, Lisa found Marge to be one of the those she received less support from as her mother firmly believes she is just going through phases. Similar to Homer, Lisa knows Marge very well and how she tends to act or think during certain moments. However, she does respect and admire Marge far more than most others.
 Bart and Lisa Bart and Lisa meeting for the first time. Being siblings, Lisa and Bart constantly get into brawls, one time after Bart destroys Lisa's centerpiece for Thanksgiving. The two once competed against each other in hockey and tried to win over Homer's love. However, the two have teamed up together many times, and they genuinely love each other. This is shown when the two were placed in the third grade in the same class (Lisa was moved up from Second Grade and Bart was moved down). The two got lost in a field trip in Capital City, forcing them to work together to survive. When Milhouse temporarily left Springfield, Bart spent more time with Lisa and the two developed a stronger bond. When Milhouse returned, Bart tried to keep their new bond intact by promising to do her chores and giving her a hug. In one episode, Lisa almost tells two college girls that she thinks Bart is cute but takes back the statement after remembering that she is talking about her brother. While Bart and Lisa have had their share of rivalry, Lisa has been shown to be less than a good sister to him on several occasions, such as boasting about how she and Maggie have a sisterly bond that Bart will never have (due to not having a brother of his own), leaving him in a chasm instead when he needed medical attention after the bullies chased him, treating Bart poorly at the school's medieval festival and blaming him for a prank he didn't commit, and kicking him down twice in Season 21. Despite treating Bart poorly on several occasions, she has shown several times that she really does care about him and his well-being. She often gives Bart advice when he needs it and will help him with any situation he's put in. Also, as a baby, her first word was ""Bart"" after hearing it so many times.
 As Lisa's baby sister, the former undoubtedly cherishes Maggie and is usually seen getting along fine with her, such as in ""O Brother, Where Bart Thou?"", where they play dress-up in the dark together during the snowstorm, and even mocks Bart for not being able to enjoy such sisterly activities. However, in ""Smart and Smarter"", Lisa becomes jealous when Maggie is crowned as the smartest person in the Simpson family, and even has a dream of her and Maggie as adults and ends up killing the latter in the dream. Lisa then decides to run away from home in order to not let Maggie's intellect outshine hers, although by the end of the episode, when it's revealed that Lisa was only helping Maggie pass the tests she was given by telling her the answers from the sidelines. The sisters are able to rekindle their relationship without any long-lasting damage to it.
 Throughout the series Lisa has had a few different crushes and even a couple of brief relationships on rare occasions, though all of them were only temporary. As is typical of her age, they are rather simple and childlike, brief, and somewhat infrequent.
 Lisa had a dream crush on a celebrity from local teen magazines named Corey Masterson, mostly in the earlier seasons.
 Lisa admitted to Homer that she liked a boy from school, Langdon Alger, although she later professed, she didn't like him anymore and may have been joking before. (The episode never actually shows Langdon, which leads one to believe he may be someone Lisa made up rather than a real person, but Langdon's appearances in the comics prove he's an actual person.)
 One time, the Krusty Burger came under fire from a non-violent environmentalist protest group named Dirt First. Lisa develops a crush on its leader, Jesse Grass (who refuses to eat anything that casts a shadow). When Springfield's oldest redwood tree is cut down with Lisa, who had been staying inside the tree as an act of protest, believed inside and dead, Jesse cuts off his favorite dreadlock and puts it on her memorial.
 Two young lovers, separated by the dome. Before the Trappuccino incident, Lisa fell in love with an Irish environmental boy named Colin. He can play the piano, guitar, trumpet, drums and bass guitar (and despite Lisa thinking so, his father is not Bono of U2). Lisa tells Marge that the best part about him is that he's not imaginary, and Marge says back that the most important thing is that he listens to Lisa. Later on, Colin reappears in minor roles but is not mentioned again, implying they broke up at some point.
 Lisa's first relationship was with a schoolyard bully, Nelson Muntz. Lisa developed a crush on him when she got detention after she found herself attracted to his grungy lifestyle enough to ask him out. After Nelson lied to Lisa about not being involved in pranking Skinner, she chose to break up with him when she realized he would not accept the changes she wanted him to make. Since then, their romantic relationship has been referred to a few different times throughout the series, most notably in the Season 22 episode, Loan-a Lisa, in which Lisa invests in Nelson's business venture and several future set episodes where they each admit that she still holds feelings for one another.
 Luke Stetson was another of Lisa’s crushes when the family stayed on a dude ranch and Luke was an animal, environment, and music lover like herself. She became so enamored that she became instantly jealous, thinking Clara was his girlfriend but later learned Clara was Luke's sister. which led to Luke becoming angry at her actions and stating he did not want to have anything to do with her anymore.
 Ralph Wiggum once had a crush on Lisa after she sent him a Valentine's Day card when nobody else in their class would. Ralph gave her tickets to the 25th anniversary Krusty the Clown Show, but his heart was broken after Lisa publicly admitted on TV that she doesn’t like him and the only reason that she gave him that card because no one else would. They’re now just friends.
 Milhouse is Lisa's Italian tutor Of all the boys Lisa has encountered, the most desperate and most prominent one is Milhouse Van Houten, who always makes attempts to win Lisa's heart. Unfortunately for Milhouse, Lisa doesn’t like him the same way. However, on a few occasions, she has begun to like him more, but they are rather infrequent and always momentary.
 Also, due to Eliza Simpson's marriage with Milford Van Houten (as revealed in ""The Color Yellow""), Milhouse is Lisa's distant cousin.
 At 10 years old, Lisa has glasses and mentions that she's the student of the month at Springfield Elementary for 48 consecutive months, which angers her brother on his own birthday.
 When Lisa was 12, she was saved from a house fire by Milhouse.
 At 13 years old, she goes to the Mayo Clinic Pre-Medical Summer Camp with Marge, where she learns chest compressions. Because of that, she's able to revive Bart after he blacks out after one of his BMX tricks at a competition, once again angering him.
 On her 14th birthday Bart and Leon Kompowsky sing new verses of her birthday song and Homer brings a cake reading ""Happy 12th Birthday."" Lisa returns home from school in the bus and discovers a letter in a suitcase while placing some packs in Marge's closet, saying that she has left Homer 7.0 and opened a bed and breakfast with the other kids, there is also a tablet with Artie Ziff mocking Homer for it. However, Marge hasn't left yet. While having dinner, Marge gets irritated at Homer for drinking beer in front of the kids and tells him to go to Moe's Tavern to drink. Marge goes into the kitchen to cry and Lisa is ready to take action. At the tavern, Lisa enters to tell Moe that Marge is going to leave Homer, and that makes Moe promise that Homer will stop drinking. He calls his sponsor to help Homer to stop, and it is Ned. He succeeds and the marriage is saved.
 At 15 years old, she’s shown applying to Harvard College and having difficulty writing her admission essay.
 At 16 years old, she goes to Milhouse's graduation party, where Bart gets angry because she's always overshadowing him. She confronts her brother, saying she's sick and tired of him, blaming her for every setback in his life, and confesses that she thinks Bart is a great artist, but he doesn't use his talent for anything. She also graduated from Springfield High School two years early and is going to go to Yale to study science on a scholarship provided by Mr. Burns. Although, Yale University is now owned by McDonald's and has banned men from taking science. Shortly after she lost her virginity to him, she tells Milhouse that she doesn't ever intend to ever get married, breaking his heart. Although she still goes to the prom with him, which she reluctantly agreed to after he saved her from the house fire. Shortly after Lisa discovered that the fire was caused by him. So she dumps Milhouse. However, Bart takes Lisa's Yale scholarship, much to her fury, in order to get his girlfriend Jenda back. Lisa gets back together with Milhouse, thinking she has no other choice, but Bart saves her after seeing how awful her future with Milhouse could be, and gives her back her scholarship. However, Harvard also accepts her, they send a drone to deliver her acceptance letter and shoot down the drones of other university's including Yale. So Lisa accepts Harvard's offer. 
 Lisa quickly becomes overwhelmed after her roommate outclasses her in every field. She feels ready to give up, until Bart - who is there making out with girls to infuriate their parents - inspires her to stay. Afterward, she goes back to her room, where she meets her second roommate who is also feeling overwhelmed. Lisa discovers that she also plays jazz and they jam before becoming close. Their relationship eventually became romantic. Lisa had two more lesbian affairs while at Harvard. Lisa studies at Harvard for the next three years. 
 At 18, she is dating Nelson, whose personality has changed entirely, and they visit Bart in his bike shop, only to discover a giant mural on her homage.
 At 19, Lisa has broken up with Nelson by now. Lisa practices her graduation speech in an empty stadium when she notices that Nelson is pushing training equipment into the storage room. The two of them talk about their past together and the time they dated. Nelson then takes Lisa back to his house, which is the bell tower of the Memorial Church. The two of them spend the entire night talking to each other and watching the sun rise the next morning. Bart then comes up the tower, looking for Lisa because the family wants to have breakfast together. Bart ends up giving Nelson his rent money then the family goes off to breakfast together. Later, Lisa performs her speech, with Nelson watching from his bell tower. As the family leaves the town, Lisa imagines what her life would be like with Nelson. Not liking what she thought about, she leaves town without saying goodbye to home.
 At age 20, one after finishing her degree in science at Harvard College, Lisa discovers that she also has a place at Yale. So, Lisa decides to do another three-year degree in an unknown subject at Yale University.
 At age 23, Lisa is finishing her degree at Yale. Where she falls in love with a handsome British young man named Hugh Parkfield who she then is going to marry. She takes Hugh to meet her family, where they, especially Homer 8.0, act embarrassing as she feared, but on the day of the wedding where she discovers Hugh refused to wear the pig cufflinks that Homer 8.0 gave to him and that Hugh wants to take her back to England because he hates her family, she dumps him since she would rather have her family. Later, Lisa entered a relationship with Hubert Wong. Hubert proposed to her on the moon, and she said yes.
 At age 24, Lisa and Hubert are on a train leaving Springfield. They watch as Snake is chased by a bounty hunter called Rott. As Snake tries to escape the train, Nelson arrives and stops him. Nelson and Lisa reunite again and Nelson reveals that he and Rott are in a relationship together. Hubert is annoyed to find that Lisa used to have a thing for Nelson, since Nelson used to bully him. The two couples then tell their relationship stories. Hubert proposed to Lisa on the moon, whilst Rott brought Nelson in as he had an overdue library book. When Lisa and Rott leave to get drinks, Hubert rips into Nelson, thinking that his life is so much better than his and that he has the last laugh, since he got Lisa and Nelson didn't. Nelson then wedgies Hubert and hangs him from a coat hook. When Lisa finds Hubert like that, she tells Nelson that he hasn't changed.
 At age 25, Lisa divorced Hubert and married Milhouse. She’s apparently unhappy in this marriage though, as she doesn’t smile in the photo taking place after their wedding, almost as if she has feelings of regret. At some point she made up with Nelson and they had an affair. She also had a child with Milhouse called Zia.
 At age 29, Nelson and Lisa meet again in a phone store, owned by Hubert. By now Lisa has divorced Milhouse and he has taken full custody of Zia. Her and Nelson go and get coffee together at Buzz Light Roast and come close to giving a relationship a chance. Before they do though, Hubert teleports in and asks Lisa to take him back because he has changed. Hubert then uses drones to apologize to Lisa, as well as write her graduation speech in the sky.  Lisa agrees to take Hubert back after Nelson tells her to go for it.
 At age 30, Jimbo and Sophie are getting married and they ask and Lisa to be their maid of honour. She agrees and goes to the wedding. She is surprised to find Nelson there. During the wedding Lisa sees Nelson go off crying. Lisa looks at Hubert, who is on his phone. She goes after Nelson. Lisa tells Nelson that she wants to be with him and the two of them kiss.
 At some point in the next seven years, she breaks up with Nelson again. She also remarries Milhouse, and retakes shared custody of Zia.
 At age 37, Lisa ran for president against Isabel Gutiérrez. They went to a presidential debate that was hosted by Anderson Cooper. In response to a question of how to end America's war in Afghanistan, she suggests throwing in the towel and just making them a sate. An aged Homer, who is watching the election on television with his Musicville counterpart, Hoba, proudly exclaims, ""That's my girl!"" Hoba agrees with a toot.
 At the age of 38, Lisa is the first female President of the United States of America. Zia is now 13. When Bart needed a digestive tract transplant, she tried to solve the mystery of 'fish logs'. She asks townspeople who tell her the story which takes place when she was still 8. She then finds out that fish logs brought Bart into the hospital in the first place. Later on, the country is broke and is forced to bring a tax hike, but things get worse when Bart interrupts everything. The leaders of the other countries are about to beat her until Bart saves her. To make it up to him, she legalizes the use of cannabis. Lisa's daughter Zia is now a bratty teenage girl who spends all her time plugged into the Ultranet. She and Bart get drunk in their old treehouse, and she asks him if she should’ve gone with Nelson. She takes Zia to spend Christmas with her parents while Milhouse nurses his seasonal allergies. Lisa tries to take Marge's suggestion of giving Zia space, but she eventually goes into the Ultranet and looks up Zia's personal Internet room, where she learns she’s actually quite studious and looks up to her, having a photo of her hung up with other inspirational women. Zia catches her, and the two reconcile.
 Not long after Christmas, Milhouse says except for the squirrel that eats their bird food, he and Lisa have nothing to talk about. However, he gets bitten by a zombie at a zombie soup kitchen that Lisa is volunteering at, and Lisa ends up finding him more attractive after he fights off bullies trying to mug them. Dr. Hibbert tells her he can reverse him, although Lisa wishes to keep Milhouse the way he is. So Milhouse remains permanently a zombie, to the delight of Lisa.
 At age 43, one year after finishing her term has president, Lisa lives with Marge on Mars and when Lisa says that she wants to leave Mars for Venus.
 Lisa dies at age 98 from natural causes after realizing that she wasted her entire life.
 The future episode ""Mother and Child Reunion"" contradicts the majority of the futures that are shown in other episodes. However, in this episode the future is shown to Lisa by Werner Herzog, who is probably not a reliable source for the future of Lisa Simpson. So the future that we see in this episode can be considered non-canon. This is the future of Lisa Simpson in this episode. It starts with a teenage Lisa who is having her final day of high school finished. As Lisa arrives at home the whole family is there to celebrate Lisa going to college. She is invited in every college but makes the shocking decision to not go to college. Marge is hurt by hearing this and asks if Lisa really doesn’t wants to go to college. As Lisa says she isn’t going to college at all. Marge is angry on Lisa and goes into the house. A few days Later Marge bakes some Brownies to change Lisa’s mind. But Lisa holds on her decision. Lisa gets a job at a fast food restaurant in Springfield mall. As she slides into an empty room, she finds a bunch of uneducated people and has the idea to teach them. Later, Lisa starts a college for uneducated people that expands countrywide. In the next scene Kent Brockman reports about the superintendent election where Lisa and Gary Chalmers debate. Meanwhile, Marge is still mad about Lisa’s decision as she hears that Lisa was elected to president. As Lisa stands at the balcony, Bart comes to see her watching fireworks. Bart then goes to see Marge who comes and apologizes to Lisa.
 Lisa is one of the playable characters in the game.
 She has small cameos in the game, though she is prominently featured in level 3 where she optionally aids Bart by dropping bowling balls on Sideshow Bob depending on whether the player managed to spell Lisa's name after defeating disguised aliens.
 Lisa has cameos in the game.
 Lisa accompanies Bart after they were tricked into going to the infamous Camp Deadly. She aids Bart via supplying him with boomerangs and various outfits during both rounds of Capture the Flag, and also plans with Bart to escape Camp Deadly by scaling Mt. Deadly. She eventually ended up captured by the camp's head, Warden Burns, although she took advantage of a blackout caused by Bart to escape her chains.
 A fairy-like version of Lisa appears in the dream sequence. Aside from this, she also appears in the ending, where she sneers at Bart in anger if he got a bad grade. If the player gets the highest possible grade, however, she expresses surprise and constantly looks at Bart and the grade in shock.
 Lisa, or rather, her likeness was a playable character in The Simpsons Bowling. 
 In The Simpsons Road Rage, Lisa drives the Elec-Taurus car and is one of the default characters. You may also pick her up off the streets when not playing as her.
 Lisa is playable in the third level of The Simpsons: Hit and Run as she looks for Bart after his disappearance. However, she makes an appearance in the first level in Springfield Elementary School, where Homer has to give her the science project she forgot. By the time the seventh level has come around, Lisa is back in the Simpson house and tells her father to go out and stock up on supplies. However, by the fourth mission, Lisa is back at the school, where she suggests that Homer goes to Mr.Burns to buy nuclear waste, which is the aliens’ weakness. When characters use the Malibu Stacy car or the Electaurus in levels four, five and six Lisa appears in the car.
 In The Simpsons Game, Lisa's powers are playing her saxophone to stun enemies, which is upgraded to force enemies to attack each other. She can also use the ""Hand of Buddha"" to pick up and drop big things telekinetically. This power is later upgraded, enabling her to attack with lightning and ice as well. She is the third character to unlock, in Lisa the Tree Hugger, after Homer and Bart and before Marge who carries Maggie around on her back.
 Matt Groening first conceived the Simpson family in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. He had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts and had intended to present his Life in Hell series. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction. He hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, and named the characters after various members of his own family, and Lisa is the name of one of his sisters. Lisa then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons clan on March 18, 1987, in the Tracey Ullman short ""Good Night"". Nancy Cartwright, originally auditioned for the role of Lisa, but was soon told that her voice would be better suited voicing Bart. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high, so Smith was given the role of Lisa instead. In order to perform the voice, Smith lifts her voice up a little.
 In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was more of a ""female Bart"" and was as equally mischievous as her brother. As the series progressed, Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional character with ""Krusty Gets Busted"" being one of the first episodes where her true intelligence is fully shown. Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, the first one being ""Moaning Lisa"". The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks, who had wanted to do an emotional episode where Lisa is sad because the show had done a lot of ""jokey episodes"". In fact, over the years, there were many episodes where Lisa played the main role. In Season 2, she was more of an intelligent person, examples include; Bart the Daredevil, One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish, The War of the Simpsons and Bart vs Thanksgiving. In later and current seasons, she is very much like any 8-year-old girl, but still shows her intelligence.
 In 2003, Lisa received a special ""Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award"" at the Environmental Media Awards. ""Lisa the Vegetarian"", an episode from the seventh season, won both an Environmental Media Award for ""Best Television Episodic Comedy"" and a Genesis Award for ""Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing Commitment"". Lisa was also listed at number 11 in TV Guide's ""Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time."" In Japan, the broadcasters of the series found they were able to turn the apparent viewer dislike of the series around by focusing marketing attention on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and city struck a chord with the Japanese.
 Lisa with brown hair As one of the five major title characters of the series, Lisa appears in almost every episode, as well as The Simpsons Movie. She had no lines in ""Chief of Hearts"" and ""Moho House"", only one line in ""Two Bad Neighbors"", ""The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase"", ""My Fare Lady"", ""Dad Behavior"", and does not appear and is not mentioned in ""Carl Carlson Rides Again"".

Maggie Simpson,False,False,True,False,False,1,Castellaneta,5,"For the rest of her relatives, refer to the The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album. Margaret  Lenny  ""Maggie"" Simpson is the one-year-old daughter and youngest child of Marge and Homer Simpson, the baby sister to Bart and Lisa Simpson and one of the five main characters of The Simpsons. She is often seen sucking on her pacifier, and when she walks, she usually trips over her clothing and falls on her face. Because she rarely ever talks, Maggie is the least seen and heard in the Simpson family. Maggie is very young, at the infant age of only 1.
 Newborn Maggie. Despite being the only member of the Simpson family who hasn't actually learned how to speak, Maggie is in no way one-dimensional and has different personality layers. She appears to be somewhat detached from the rest of her family and was once described as ""the forgotten Simpson"" by Homer. When she, Bart and Lisa were shipped over to a foster home at the Flanders' after their parents were deemed unfit, Maggie was the quickest to adapt and cane close to joining them until her real mother Marge called for her and Maggie ""became a Simpson again."" 
 Maggie is shown to sport a stronger devotion to her mother than her father, possibly because Marge is always home or shopping with her while Homer is mostly at his job working or hanging at Moe's Tavern. Once, when Homer tried to bond with her, she tried to run away. She developed a father-daughter relationship with Moe, who once saved her life. However, she still does love Homer and has more than once saved his life, not to mention she said her first word, ""Daddy"" directly after Homer tucked her in, although no one heard her.
 At the beginning, Maggie seemed to rely on Marge alot and the likewise but eventually became fiercely independent as she was able to plan a Great Escape-style breakout from a daycare center to get all the babies' pacifiers back, which were being held under lock and key. Although treated by almost everyone as a natural and helpless baby, she, in fact, sometimes exhibits violent mannerisms and a surprising amount of physical strength. She was able to wield a mallet and bludgeon her father with it after being influenced by Itchy and Scratchy, as well as able to drag her father back to the shore when he got caught in a riptide. She is also surprisingly proficient with firearms and is a natural markswoman, shown when she used a rifle to incapacitate Fat Tony and his henchmen, winging them all and driving them off when they came to kill her parents.
 Maggie is also somewhat mischievous to a specific extent. When Homer was largely immobilized as a result of wearing a body cast, she spun him around like a bottle and took great joy in the endeavor. (This happened immediately after Bart wrote something on Homer's chest and refused to tell him what.) She also once locked her family out of the bathroom and bounced a ball as they yelled for her to let them in.
 When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, she and Homer bought their first home. Seven years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to quit his job at the power plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. Soon after, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, and, unable to support his new family member, Homer reapplied for his job at the power plant. Homer fell into a deep depression as a result, but, when he held Maggie for the first time after she was born, he loved her at first sight. He keeps all of Maggie's baby photos in his office to cheer him up at his workplace.
 
For the first 101 episodes of the show and from seasons 1 to 5 (The Boy Who Knew Too Much), Maggie was not a year old yet and was considered to be in her first twelve months between the series' premiere of Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire and Season 5's The Boy Who Knew Too Much. Maggie turned a year old in Lady Bouvier's Lover and has stayed that way ever since that episode.  Maggie is impressionable and easily influenced by what she sees around her. She once hit Homer on the head with a mallet, shot a suction dart at his picture, and brandished a pencil in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy.  Also, she shot Mr. Burns  although it is not clear if she actually shot him or if his gun, which fell out of his pocket, discharged when they tussled over her lollipop, which he was trying to steal from her. She battled Baby Gerald during the Springfield St. Patrick’s Day Riot, when the two found themselves on opposite sides.  One time, when the Simpson's home was being raided by an angry mob, she was able to smash her baby bottle and use it as a makeshift weapon (against Krusty's monkey, which quickly ran away) but the house was still ransacked in The Simpsons Movie; in the movie, she also knocked Russ Cargill, the villainous head of the EPA, unconscious by dropping a rock on his head when he was gonna shoot Homer.
 She is keenly aware of her surroundings and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. Like Bart, Lisa, and Homer, she is not content of spending time with her aunts Patty and Selma. It is also known that she and Baby Gerald mutually dislike each other very much, despite apparently marrying and in one of the Simpsons Comics.
 Maggie bears a fairly strong resemblance to Lisa, even looking near identical to her in future appearances. She has yellow skin and blonde, pointed star-like hair that matches the color of her skin, just like Lisa. She wears light blue footie pajamas without leg holes with a light blue hair bow and is almost always sucking on a red pacifier. At night, her sleep suit and hair bow are white. When not sucking on the pacifier, she most often has a straight lip just like Marge and Lisa, but sometimes, she has a curved upper lip like Homer.
 ""Holidays of Future Passed"" shows her quitting her pacifier at around 3 or 4, and at 8 she stopped wearing her bow, although some of her adult appearances show her with a hair bow, not to mention that this episode is non-canon. In her future appearances as a teenager and adult, her hair is longer and still in its star-like shape, except her first 3 ""points"" of hair fall forward and the rest are worn back (at least when her head is seen at a third quarter angle like most cartoon characters are seen at). She’s usually wearing at least one article of blue clothing in these appearances.
 Although Maggie generally doesn't talk due to her being a little baby, there have been various occasions where Maggie has had words of spoken dialogue. Most of her speaking roles aren’t to be considered canon, however, with the only known true lines of dialogue being the ones said in Lisa's First Word, Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily, Lisa Gets an ""A"", The Simpsons Movie, Coming to Homerica, Friends and Family, and There Will Be Buds.
 Maggie can be a violent child, especially for her youthful age. Maggie once had a violent encounter with Homer after watching the violent mannerism acts from Itchy and Scratchy. She had hit him over the head with a mallet and later attempted to stab him with a pencil.
 When Mr. Burns planned to cover up the sun, he was shot by Maggie while trying to steal candy from her. The citizens of Springfield deemed it ""an accident"". After figuring this out, it cleared Homer of all charges. She later tried to shoot an amnesiac Burns again with a shotgun in her own house but Lisa stopped her before she could do so.
 On another occasion, Lisa enlisted Maggie to be her fencing partner. However, when Lisa inadvertently condescended to the baby, Maggie dueled her proficiently and quickly overwhelmed her, even slashing an M into Lisa's shirt, Zorro-style.
 When members of the local Mafia were going to kill Marge and Homer, Maggie shot and incapacitated them all with an air gun. Her parents never learned it was she who saved them.
 In The Simpsons Movie, when the mob was attacking the Simpson family home, Krusty told his monkey, Mr. Teeny, to take out the baby, referring to Maggie. She then broke her baby bottle making rigid spikes of glass, showing that she was ready to take him on; this scared Teeny, who ran into Krusty's arms. Later on, in the same movie when the villainous Russ Cargill was about to shoot Homer, she dropped a rock on to his head, knocking him unconscious. Her violent actions are often illustrated as somewhat innocent or at least unintentional except when she is actively protecting herself or her family.
 Maggie takes after her sister in many ways. Not only does she greatly resemble Lisa (looking exactly like her in a blue dress in flash-forwards to the future), she also is brilliant and musically inclined like her sister. Maggie can play the saxophone with great ability, despite the fact that she’s only a year old. In Lisa's Wedding and Holidays of Future Passed, it’s implied that Maggie is a fantastic singer, again taking after her sister. In the latter episode, Maggie becomes a famous rock star. She’s the lead singer of her band, is referred to as ""the voice of her generation"" on her Christmas card and plays lead guitar.
 Maggie has, on numerous, numerous occasions, demonstrated that her agility—both mental and physical—is extremely advanced for her age. She organized the other infants at the Ayn Rand School for Tots to steal a key so they could reclaim their pacifiers which had been confiscated. She figured out communication signals, gathered supplies, used the window-blinds string to pull herself into the ventilation shafts, used a Krusty Doll to lower herself into the room containing the Key (holding bottles to weight herself down and then dropping them so the string would retract), shot a suction-cup line across the room, slid across it with a hanger, and used the key to unlock the locker holding the children's pacifiers, decidedly an insider-joke imitation of Tom Cruise's maneuverings in the film ""Mission Impossible"". She also commonly moves along ropes with ease by hand-over-handing her way across them, such as when she tried to escape from Homer who was trying to bond with her by climbing across the clothesline. She usually keeps her intelligence a secret, as in A Streetcar Named Marge.
 She once crawled all over town to her mother's favorite hangouts trying to track down her mother, who was on a well-deserved vacation. Maggie usually has a good understanding of her circumstances and surroundings and has at times tried to point out the obvious to adults (mostly Homer) who are oblivious to what is going on. She knows how to read and was seen trying to communicate to Homer using baby blocks but failed because Homer can't read. Maggie has spelled out E=MC2 with her blocks before  and can change her own diapers, just as Lisa could when she was a baby. She has also used a fire extinguisher to put out burning curtains, driven Homer's car, skateboarded, and already said her first word despite being only a year old.
 Although Maggie shows a natural inclination to weapons (see the above section for examples of her ability to defend herself), and aggression, she also has saved members of her family on various occasions, such as when she swam out to sea and saved Homer from drowning or when she saved Bart and Lisa from Groundskeeper Willie in Treehouse of Horror VI.
 Maggie also seems to take after her father in bowling, as she has already bowled a perfect game (something it took Homer 39 years to do) at the age of 1.
 On some level, Maggie is like Bart. Like her brother, she is capable of underhanded scheming and rallying others (like the babies at the daycare) in common cause, much as Bart frequently does with his friends and peers. More recently, she developed an interest in whistling, so Homer attempted to launch her baby-celebrity career, but this was sidelined by her first tooth emerging.
 Maggie has done and demonstrated numerous things, like voting for Homer, accurate sharpshooting, leading rebellious crowds, bowling skills and numerous other skills.
 Homer has, at times, forgotten Maggie's existence and Maggie, in turn, has shown disinterest and even fear towards her dad. In fact, she wasn't above targeting him after seeing a cartoon and running away from him when he tried to bond with her or when Marge asked him to hold her. 
 Nevertheless, she recognizes his heart and has shown herself willing to do whatever it takes to save or aid him. When he was on the verge of drowning, Maggie stopped at nothing to rescue him and when he was kidnapped by a crazed tow-trucker, she rode out to liberate him and bring him home (despite earlier wriggling out of his grip to get to Marge). In addition, when Homer and Marge were threatened by the local mob, she used a shotgun to disarm and injure them all and her parents never learned she was the shooter. At one point, when she thought Homer was lost at sea with Bart, she was clearly saddened (like Marge and Lisa) but was overjoyed when she saw him alive and hugged his arm in response. At one point, she gave her father one of her dolls to take care of to cheer him up and, while giving him a warm hug, replaced a dream version of Flanders (a reference to her once being one of his foster children) with one of Homer. Maggie's first word was, ""Daddy"", although no one was around to hear it. In ""Eeny Teeny Maya, Moe"", she was smiling while he pushed her stroller after Marge had him bond with her. Homer tried to save her from bullies, and she protected him after he was overpowered.
 In ""Lisa's Wedding"", a teenage Maggie has a framed photo of her and Homer prominently in her room, suggesting they have a closer bond as she gets older.
 Maggie has a much closer bond with her mother than anyone else in the family. This was most evident when, forced to choose between the Flanders family or the Simpsons in a custody matter, she was undecided until Marge appeared and Maggie ran to her. In addition, when Marge was missing for a time (actually on a personal much-needed vacation), a saddened Maggie spent a large amount of time looking for her, even going so far as to search in all of the places she typically goes with her. And whenever she is worried or frightened and Marge is around, she always goes to her for comfort and security. Even then, however, she, at times, rebels against her mother's parenting by refusing to eat certain foods and resisting her mother's insistence that she wear an uncomfortable sweater.
 Like the other members of her family, Maggie has at times shown aggravation towards Bart. At one point, she even slapped him repeatedly for choices that he made. And when she was ""a mean drunk"" after ""getting high off the beer fumes"", she drunkenly threw slow punches at him and at one point even had him in a stranglehold, although Bart did not appear to be fighting back. She also (in her own way) tattled on Bart, letting her parents know that he had a dolphin in his possession. Despite this, Maggie loves her brother very much. So much so, she played with him when he couldn't see Milhouse for a while, pulled several pranks with him, and joyfully square-danced with him at a Dude Ranch.
 In addition, after he returned from a very poorly planned disastrous trip to France, Maggie gave him a loving hug upon seeing him again. On another occasion, she played a brief game of Police Detective with him. When Bart was accused of a prank, he, surprisingly, did NOT commit, she alone knew he was innocent and convinced her entire family to fight for Bart.
 In one of the episodes, Bart starts singing some lullabies to her when she feels tired or scared, after he sing to her, he promises to her that he will sing her every night when she feels tired or fearing herself when he did with his father and other sister.
 During two Treehouse of Horror segments, Maggie held onto Bart for security when climbing down from the tree house and when falling asleep, laid on him. However, she happily stole money from him, only to suck on, though, in lieu of a pacifier.
 After Marge, Maggie seems to be closest to Lisa. The two have similar levels of intelligence and general interests despite their youth and have a strong sisterly bond. Also, next to Marge and Homer, Lisa holds and carries Maggie the most. However, Maggie does express annoyance with Lisa at times and will occasionally act smug towards her, such as when she developed her whistling ability.
 The two are not on good terms after Maggie shot him. Although the hatred she has for him is strong, she gave him his stuffed animal, Bobo.
 When she, her brother, and sister go to live with the Flanders, she seems fine with it, especially when she said Daddily Doodily after spending time with the Flanders family. 
 Aside from a non-canon word of his name in Flaming Moes, she’s shown to like Moe as in a few episodes especially in ""Moe Baby Blues"", where he’s shown that he likes spending time with her.
 In ""Marge on the Lam"", when Homer gets his arms stuck in two vending machines, he remarks that ""Oh, I’m gonna have these things on my arms forever.” Once this is said, Homer has a fantasy of Maggie’s wedding in the First Church of Springfield where Maggie removes the pacifier and kisses an unknown man.
 Nine-year-old Maggie in ""Future-Drama"" In ""Future-Drama"", Maggie, now a nine year old kid, went on holidays to Alaska, which became a sunny beach due to global warming. At this age, she looks exactly like Lisa does currently.
 9-year-old Maggie kissing Gerald in ""Barthood"" In ""Barthood"", Maggie is seen as a nine year old again, and she and Gerald kiss while at Milhouse's graduation party with Bart and Lisa.
 16-year-old Maggie in ""Lisa's Wedding"" In ""Lisa's Wedding"", Maggie is seen as a 16-year-old with a punk-like style. She’s shown to wear her trademark pacifier around her neck as a necklace. According to Homer and Dr. Hibbert respectively, she never shuts up, although ironically whenever she tries to speak, she is always interrupted, and is ""quite the hellion"". The latter mentions she has an incredible singing voice before she almost performs ""Amazing Grace"" at the wedding, but she’s interrupted by Hugh announcing that the wedding is off. Despite her punk-like exterior, she has multiple books scattered across her room, hinting that she's intelligent like Lisa, while she likely gets her attitude from Bart. She also has a dirt bike trophy and a photo of her and Homer above her bed, hinting they have a closer bond in the future. 
 Maggie with her band in Holidays of Future Passed In ""Bart to the Future"", she’s 31 and she has a daughter, Maggie Jr., who looks exactly the same as Maggie and Lisa did as infants. She doesn’t actually appear in the episode, but a deleted scene revealed she became an astronaut.
 31-year-old Maggie with her newborn daughter in ""Holidays of Future Passed"" In ""Holidays of Future Passed., it is seen through a 30-year photo montage that she grows up to be a world-famous rock star by age 22, acting as the lead singer in her band and also playing guitar, and being dubbed ""The Voice of Her Generation"". In the episode, she is 31 and pregnant, and has her baby, a girl who looks just like her as an infant, while traveling to visit her family for Christmas. Maggie once again is not heard speaking, as her doctor told her to not speak until she gave birth due to new research discovering the umbilical cord is actually a vocal cord. When she arrives home with her baby girl, she is cut off by Grampa when she tries to answer his question of who her baby's father is. It’s implied it’s one of her band members, as when asked by the doctor they refused to answer.
 Maggie's brief cameo in ""Days of Future Future"" Maggie only makes a brief cameo in ""Days of Future Future"", where she and Gerald are seen sharing a drink while staring romantically at each other . This also hints that Gerald may be the father of Maggie's baby from Holidays of Future Passed.
 In ""Flanders' Ladder"", she’s revealed to never pass on, becoming a constellation.
 Matt Groening, the creator of the Simpsons franchise, first conceived the Simpson family in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. He had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts and had intended to present his Life in Hell series. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening chose to go in another direction. He hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after various members of the family of his own. Maggie was named after Matt Groening's younger sister, Margaret ""Maggie"" Groening. She often sucked on a pacifier and wore a sleep suit, two traits Groening used for Maggie. Then Maggie made her debut with the rest of the Simpson clan on April 19, 1987, aged 3 months, in the Tracey Ullman short Good Night.
 Groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up but assigned any emotions that the scene required. Her comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk (though this has been downplayed in later seasons), and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period, and by Nancy Cartwright during the normal series.
 During the show's opening sequence, Maggie is run through a supermarket checkout scanner, which reads that she is worth $847.63 (a reference to the monthly cost of infant-rearing way back in 1989). In The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular, the scanner instead reads ""NRA4EVER"", a reference to the running joke that the show's creators are right-wing radicals. In the more recently aired episodes, her price has changed to $486.52 (possibly because of the change in the cost of infant-rearing). In the Treehouse of Horror XXIV couch gag introduced by Guillermo del Toro the scanner reads 666 instead, referring to the number of Satan.
 With few exceptions, Maggie never speaks but is very participatory in the events around her, emoting with subtle gestures and facial expressions. Maggie has spoken in Good Night, the first short to air, after the family falls asleep. There was another time she had tried to talk in Making Faces short upon the task given by Bart and Lisa. Liz Georges had done the voice of Maggie in Good Night, then Yeardley Smith did it in ""Babysitting Maggie"", ""Making Faces"", ""Football"", ""House of Cards"", and ""The Money Jar"".
 In Bart vs. Thanksgiving, Bart has a vision of what could happen if he returned home after destroying Lisa's centerpiece. In this vision, Maggie says to him telepathically: ""It's your fault I can't talk!""
 Maggie's first word spoken in the normal continuity of the series occurred in Lisa's First Word, when she was voiced by Elizabeth Taylor, whose voice role as Maggie was named the thirteenth greatest guest spot in the history of the show by IGN. James Earl Jones, who voiced Maggie in Treehouse of Horror V, was in seventh place. She later on had brief dialogue in Treehouse of Horror IX at the end of segment ""Starship Poopers"", the third act, voiced by Harry Shearer using Kang's voice. For a few Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Yeardley Smith did many of Maggie's non-sucking noises and occasional speaking parts, but for The Simpsons Movie and since the 1st season, her non-sucking noises and occasional speaking parts are done by Nancy Cartwright. Although she has spoken a load of times, she has only had two. 
 Maggie had saved Bart and Lisa from Groundskeeper Willie in Treehouse of Horror VI and saved Homer from being killed by mobsters in Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge. She even rescued her archenemy, Baby Gerald, from floating into space in a Simpson comic story called ""Bringing Down Baby"". Maggie saved Homer a second time in The Simpsons Movie from the villainous Russ Cargill by rolling a small boulder down onto his head. Homer once said, ""What a great little accident you turned out to be"", referring to the fact that she was conceived at a time that none of her parents intended to. She also saved her father from drowning in a riptide and rescued him from being held prisoner by an insane tow trucker from Guidoville whom Homer had offended. In the Season 27 episode Puffless, she, along with the help of Plopper and an army of animal friends, save a possum from The Spuckler Family.

 As one of the five major title characters of the series, Maggie appears in a majority of all the episodes, as well as The Simpsons Movie and the Simpsons games. However, due to her young age and lack of major plot involvement, Maggie is often shown briefly in certain episodes as a background character. There are 34 episodes, where Maggie doesn't appear at all.

Akira,True,False,False,False,False,2,stars,6,"Akira (あきら) is the sensei of a karate dojo, a waiter at The Happy Sumo sushi restaurant, a waiter at the Swanky Fish sushi restaurant, and an employee at Costington's department store.
 As a young boy in Japan, Akira was a minor child-star on television. He spent four years playing the part of ""Whitey"" on ""Let Trouble-Makey Beaver Do Himself."" a Japanese sitcom inspired by a 1950's American TV show. As he grew older, acting jobs became scarce, so Akira enrolled in a cooking school. Upon graduation, he came to America and opened a restaurant in Springfield called ""The Happy Sumo."" In addition to the culinary arts, Akira practices the martial arts, teaching karate at the Springfield Learning Annex. Lately, Akira has returned to his first love, acting. He has recently been seen on the stage of the Little Tokyo Theater in Kabuki productions of ""Sumo Like it Hot"" and ""A Raisin in the Rising Sun.""
 Akira has a mixed relationship with Homer. Akira helped Homer, Bart, and Lisa Simpson to discover the origin of the mysterious Mr. Sparkle dishwashing detergent box (Homer was mystified by Mr. Sparkle's striking resemblance to him). However, he nearly killed Homer (albeit not intentionally) when he served him the fugu blowfish, which can only be properly prepared by the Master Sushi Chef (who was busy making out in his car with Mrs. Krabappel when Homer ordered the fugu). Also, Akira, Luigi, Captain McCallister, and other restaurant proprietors of Springfield attempted to assassinate Homer for giving their restaurants bad reviews.
 On yet another occasion, Akira demonstrated a vibrating recliner for Homer in the furniture department at Costington's at Homer's insistence, with the chair set to full power. Homer loved the chair, but Marge talked him out of buying it.
 AKkira with eggs on his head Akira trained Marge in Jiu-Jitsu for an MMA fight working with her in his own karate studio. Bart also signed up for one of Akira's karate classes, but skipped the sessions to go play video games.
 
Akira had to take a citizenship test when a proposition called for all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported. Akira, with sea captain on the plane Akira as Sulu from Star Trek Akira is featured in level three of The Simpsons Game, ""Around the World in 80 Bites"". He is shown as the former winner of the Duff eating contest because of his technique of dipping food in milk then swallowing it whole. In the Wii Version, he is the opponent of the minigame Bite Night found in the level Game Over.
 Akira can be seen in the closing credits as Sulu from Star Trek, as a nod to George Takei, who played Sulu, providing the voice of Akira in his first appearance.

Ms. Albright,False,False,False,False,False,1,Roswell,7,"Ms. Albright is the Sunday school teacher at the First Church of Springfield.
 Ms. Albright teaches Sunday school and once had Bart Simpson as a student some time ago, a time that she undoubtedly dreaded. When Bart came back to Sunday school in order to get close to Jessica Lovejoy, a current student, she is frightened, but decides to welcome him back. Shortly after she presents a replica of the “slingshot” David used to slay Goliath for Pass Around. She then keeps herself busy by bending over a file cabinet. This tempts Bart to aim the slingshot at her wiggling butt. He manages to refrain himself from firing in order to impress Jessica.
 Ms. Albright has dark red hair with a magenta headband. She wears a white collarless shirt with two buttons inside a light blue skirt. She wore glasses in ""The Telltale Head"".
 With Bart Note: Many of her appearances are brief, background roles. Episodes in which she has an actual role are in bold.

Dolph Starbeam,True,False,False,False,False,1,Hayden,8,"Dolph showing Bart the Scream that they stole. Dolphin George ""Dolph"" Starbeam, also known as Dolph Shapiro, is one of the school bullies of Springfield Elementary, with Shauna Chalmers, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Jimbo Jones, Nelson Muntz, and the Weasels. He is of Jewish origin and can speak multiple languages. Bart Simpson later became friends with Dolph. He is a 14 to 15-year-old sixth grader and is the youngest of the trio of bullies.
 Dolph is considered the ""softest"" of all the bullies and has sometimes been seen running away once overpowered by the enemy. He is also the smartest education-wise, as he has quite a long list of secondary skills ranging from horse-riding to playing the guitar, and has been held back the least of them.
 The son of aging, die-hard hippies, Dolph had taken all the flower power he could stomach by the age of six. He had given peace a chance but chose that hitting other kids was more fun, so he traded in his Birkenstocks for a pair of Doc Martens. Dolph drinks alcohol and smokes cigarettes with Jimbo. Dolph's brutish behavior and distaste for authority eventually led him to kindred souls Kearney, Jimbo, and Nelson. Dolph can frequently be seen in the Springfield Elementary restroom, flushing the toilet while someone's head is in it.
 Dolph is recognized by his asymmetrical haircut which covers one side of his face, and a dolphin-like mouth. He wears cutoff shorts and Chuck Taylor All-Stars style basketball shoes. Dolph is 13-14 years old. He is also left-handed. Depending on the shade used, Dolph's hair can appear either a deep red, or brown.
 Getting held back a couple years, Dolph is a sixth-grade student at Springfield Elementary. Dolph once attended Hebrew school, and according to a school profile in ""24 Minutes"", he speaks ""Spanish, German, Hebrew, Arabic, Korean, Latin, Old English, Klingon, and Esperanto"", he is ""friends with: Jackie Chan (unverified)"" and his ""special skills"" include ""horse riding, tap dancing, British accent, stage fighting."". In the episode, “MyPods and Boomsticks”, Dolph is revealed to be Jewish.
 Dolph is a player in the Mighty Pigs Pee Wee Hockey League Team, and in ""Kamp Krusty"" he shows that he can play the guitar.
 Despite having appeared since the first season of the show, Dolph's name is not mentioned on-screen until the fourth season episode ""Kamp Krusty"". In the episode, he becomes a counselor at Kamp Krusty with Jimbo and Kearney. He serves the camper's gruel and plays the guitar to force them to sing.
 It is implied that Dolph may have suffered from child abuse. In ""Black-eyed Please"", after getting detention from Ms. Cantwell, Lisa asks Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney, and Nelson why one becomes a bully, and Dolph's response is ""abuse"". Dolph's mother and father are now divorced and he has two fathers who are presumably homosexual. Theoretically one would be the 'die-hard-hippy' mentioned previously, while the other has an eye-patch and has been seen beating up Homer. When reading the then-recently released Angry Dad comics, Dolph saw Angry Dad's behavior as being similar to those of his own dads (he may have been referring only to the latter). He also has a sister who is constantly watched by the police (via surveillance camera ).
 Dolph appears as one of the three museum thieves that Bart and Homer must defeat.
 DS: Bart has to shoot targets in the dark three times before stopping him.
 All others: Bart has fire a crystal at a target on a skeleton of a dinosaur, thus trapping him.
 Dolph heard about the Duff Eating Contest and would like to enter it but his Trainer would kill him. Later he becomes impressed about Homer and tells it to Bart.
 Dolph saw Loggers in the Forrest and doesn't want them to hurt the Trees and later told Bart it was a good thing he did for the Trees.
 Afterwards he bought the New Grand Theft Scratchy Game and assisted the other kids in Attacking Anyone that gets in their way. Later When the Aliens Arrive in Springfield Dolph saw the Dolphins, Lard Lad, and the aliens attacking Springfield, sometimes whenever Bart encounters Dolph in Springfield he tells him that he can't believe the Dolphins left without squealing. He then congrats him for Hazing Lard Lad and calls Lard Lad a nerd. And remarks because Bart saved the mall Capitalism can once again Flourish.
 Dolph has a card in The Simpsons Classic Collection Volume One.
 ""With long, greasy brown hair, slovenly attire and a soul to match, Dolph is the perfect yes-man, provided your questions involve petty thievery, cheesing people off, and beating up science geeks. Yet, Dolph's sensitive side is sometimes revealed when he lies on his back and talks to clouds."" Favorite job: Serving pine cones to the campers at Kamp Krusty.
 Zombie Dolph also has a card in The Simpsons Horror Edition.
 ""As a zombie, Dolph is slack-jawed and sullen. A greasy hank of hair slashes across his pale face. His speech is guttural and filled with a hungry moaning. And without a trace of conscience, he preys upon the small and the weak. In other words, not much has changed.""
 In ""Days of Future Future"", he, Jimbo, and Kearney attempt to rob Milhouse and Lisa but Milhouse fights by using Ralph Wiggum to knock them out and later cook their brains.
 In ""Barthood"", he, Jimbo, and Kearney are seen at Milhouse's graduation party.
 Dolph was named after one of Matt Groening's classmates from Lincoln High School named Dolph Timmerman. Groening stated that Timmerman was not a bully but just a real cool guy.
 During much of the series, Dolph was generally regarded as the most mysterious of the bullies and never really had a big part. We learn he is Jewish as shown in See Homer Run. He is also considered the best looking out of them. He's starting to have more speaking parts and he could be the softest out of the primary bully trio, although this is mainly due to less development. Some fans have offered criticism for the show's writers, citing that in The Simpsons' nearly twenty-year run, Dolph is one of the very few characters to be almost entirely undeveloped and has significantly fewer lines than Jimbo or Kearney despite sharing adequate screentime with them. However, in more recent seasons he is gradually speaking more and we are finally learning more about him.
 Dolph's family name was revealed in Simpsons Comics #75. However, in the Simpsons World episode guide, Dolph is listed only by his first name along with Kearney (page 156). However in Season 25 Episode 7 ""Yellow Subterfuge"" his name is shown as Dolph Shapiro, which is a name with Jewish origins.

Jimbo Jones,True,False,False,False,False,1,Hayden,9,"Corky Jimmy ""Jimbo"" Jones, also known as James, Jamesbo, and Hector Gutierrez, is a student and bully at Springfield Elementary, with Dolph Starbeam, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Nelson Muntz, and the Weasels. He is a sixth grader and has been held back multiple years.
 Jimbo was originally introduced in the episode ""The Telltale Head"" by Bart as 'the worst kid in school'. He is the second-in-command of the bullies, being their leader when Nelson isn't around, not that Nelson has any interest in hierarchic systems. Jimbo has an on-and-off friendship with Bart Simpson that depends on how badly Bart is willing to behave and whether he has any lunch money or not.
 Jimbo wears a purple beanie, a black short-sleeved T-shirt emblazoned with a menacing white skull, blue jeans, and black and white shoes. His original attire instead had a yellow short-sleeved dress shirt, and he originally did not wear a knit cap. Girls consider him one of the best-looking boys in town along with Dolph Starbeam, and Bart describes him as ""a good-looking rebel who plays by his own rules.""
 According to the episode ""Beware My Cheating Bart"", he has a bald spot underneath his hat (although it was not seen earlier in ""Bart of Darkness"" or ""Lisa the Drama Queen""). The bald spot is also shown in ""Lisa Gets the Blues"".
 A real low-life, Jimbo is acknowledged as the leader of the bully gang in the absence of Nelson, the latter being more fearsome and domineering, as well as tenacious and explosively deviant, even more so than him. Jimbo is often seen hanging out with fellow bullies and best friends Dolph, Kearney, and sometimes Nelson and his girlfriend Lisa Simpson. Jimbo sometimes shows a decent friendship with younger, yet more popular fellow troublemaker Bart, although Bart is more of a rebel than a bully, and Jimbo is just as likely to bully him as any other smaller, weaker person. Appropriate to his kind of person, Jimbo only picks his excursions when he knows that he can get away with it, as when in the face of someone or something more threatening and stronger than them, Jimbo will flee or when cornered, grovel to save his own skin.
 Jimbo enjoys intimidating his classmates and shoplifting. He has been kicked out of all four Space Mutant movies. Jimbo used to have a skateboard, just like Bart. He smokes cigarettes and drinks alcohol with Dolph and Kearney. Jimbo also sometimes uses marijuana and other narcotics. It is also implied that Jimbo has a job as a police informant.
 Despite his reputation as a bully, Jimbo is Christian, and sometimes shows strong moral standards. At one point, when he reveals to Martin that the ""paint"" vendor he got the unicorn tattoo from was actually a tattoo parlor at the Skewed Over event, he notably showed hesitance at beating up Martin at that point as he ""had it rough already"", even stating to the other bullies that it might not be a good idea to beat him up. However, he ultimately chooses to beat Martin up with the other bullies.
 Jimbo's parents are Mr. Jones and Carol Jones. It is often implied that his mother is sexually promiscuous, possibly working as a prostitute. It is also stated that Jimbo's mother and Kearney have been sexually involved sometime in the past. She sometimes walks around topless, which impresses Kearney and Dolph. Jimbo has a sister; he, Nelson, Kearney, and Dolph use the case from her retainer as an ingredient in a stink bomb to sabotage Springfield Elementary's bake sale with. It is hinted that his family is moderately well-off when, during the time a teacher's strike closed the school, he and his mother watch soap operas and sip tea together in a very nice living room. Given that Jimbo's father, Mr. Jones, seemed to be a beer-drinking lowlife when seen in another episode, it may be that Jimbo is an illegitimate child. His mother may be involved with ""bad boys"". 
 Jimbo shoplifting Despite his lowlife nature and cowardly stature, he has been shown to be the most cunning and plotting of the three as the impromptu auxiliary leader. Many times, when Marge Simpson is around, they are able to successfully deceive and distract her before pulling off their antics right under her nose. When Lisa saves Bart from the bullies one time, Jimbo says to Bart, ""It's a lucky coincidence you happen to be your sister's brother."". Another time, Jimbo laughs at Bart's pajamas, and mockingly asks if ""his mommy bought them for him"". When Bart replies with ""Of course, she did. Who else would have?"", Jimbo looks blank for a while before declaring that Bart has won (""this time"").
 He was kidnapped by Stewie Griffin in ""The Simpsons Guy"".
 Jimbo is the second-in-command of the gang of bullies at Springfield Elementary School consisting of him, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Dolph Starbeam, Nelson Muntz, and the Weasels. Jimbo constantly bullies other children and has on many occasions been shown to beat up Nelson, even though he is friends with him.
 Jimbo with Laura Jimbo is quite popular with girls his age, despite the fact that he attends an elementary school, and they seem to consider him more of an outlaw than the scumbag he usually behaves as. It's been implied that Lisa may have a crush on him. Jimbo is also not a virgin. In the episode ""Kamp Krusty,"" he says that he and Dolph are ""going across the lake to get some tail.""
 Jimbo temporarily became the boyfriend of Bart's 15-year-old babysitter and then-new next-door neighbor Laura Powers, whom Bart had a crush on. However, he got even one night, when Laura was babysitting him and had Jimbo over. Bart made one of his trademark prank calls to Moe's Tavern and told Moe when he found out it was a prank that his name was Jimbo Jones of 1094 Evergreen Terrace (Note that the Simpsons' address was inconsistent in the early seasons). Moe came to the house with a rusty knife and when threatened, Jimbo began to cry and cower pathetically in the corner, revealing that he wasn't the tough and wild ""bad boy"" that Laura saw in him. Laura then broke up with Jimbo shortly afterwards.
 Jimbo temporarily became one of Bart's friends, like Milhouse, and became his next-door neighbor. Bart warns Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Maggie of Jimbo paying a visit to 742 Evergreen Terrace. However, Jimbo got even with him while he stayed with Bart. When Jimbo and Homer visited Bart's bedroom, Marge made one of her trademark home schools for Jimbo and Bart to go on Olde Springfield Towne and told them when they found out it was a Fort Sensible that had Sandy Petersen. Jimbo warns Bart to stop Fort Sensible's army general. They hop on the general's horse and make one of their trademark prank calls to the army general and told him ""(how about cut the Indians in.) Actually, we will call that book kutten-u-out.""
 Jimbo was also romantically involved with Shauna, before she broke up with him after a confrontation with Lisa in ""Beware My Cheating Bart"".
 Jimbo suggests that he stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy dolls because ""they demean women."" At one time, Homer Simpson told Jimbo, ""Your king commands it."" and Jimbo boldly replies with ""Jesus is our only king."" In ""Mypods and Boomsticks,"" it's stated by Bart that Jimbo is Christian.
 Jimbo being bullied by nerdy bullies, before he became a bully. An issue of the Simpsons Comics revealed a backstory for Jimbo. When Jimbo was a new student at Springfield Elementary School, he wore a yellow short-sleeved dress shirt, a pink tie, and blue jeans; in those days, there were nerdy bullies, so nerds ran the school with a mix of high attendance, GPAs and cruelty. Jimbo's shirt got ripped off by nerdy bullies when the nerds pushed him on a chair with glue on it. Willie gave Jimbo the T-shirt that he now wears, and he was nicknamed ""Jimbo"" because of his low IQ. All of this led to Jimbo's own violent bullying nature.
 Jimbo at age 7. Note, however, that this contradicts the flashback in the episode Lisa's Sax, where Jimbo was first introduced as the official school bully, by Principal Skinner.
 According to Simpsons Comics 57, he is allergic to bee stings.
 Jimbo appears as one of the three museum engineers that Sea Captain and Principal Skinner must defeat. He also is one of the holders of the three Sparklemon that Homer and Chazz Busby must defeat.
 Jimbo spends about half of Halloween promising not to egg people's houses in return for candy, and the other half egging their houses. He doesn't always bother with a costume either - he scares kids enough as it is.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror III"", Jimbo and the gang are turned into zombies, predictably due to their late-night loitering, and are seen kicking Zombie Principal Skinner's head around around Springfield Elementary.
 He was killed and made into burgers - or rather, Sloppy Jimbos in ""Treehouse of Horror V"" after tripping Lunchlady Doris. 
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XVIII"", he, Dolph, and Kearney form the three heads of a parody of Cerberus, condemned to spend eternity guarding the gates of Hell and arguing over whose 'junk' it is.
 In ""The Simpsons Guy"", he is seen at the car wash and later is kidnapped by Stewie Griffin.
 Zombie Jimbo is a card in The Simpsons Horror Edition.
 ""Smacking his lips, licking his chops, and grubbing for brains, Zombie Jimbo is a stumbling, stinking, decomposing horror show. What Zombie Jimbo doesn't know won't hurt him. And he doesn't know much. So, he's practically invincible.""
 In ""Days of Future Future"", he, Kearney, and Dolph attempt to rob Milhouse Van Houten and Lisa Simpson but Milhouse fights back using Ralph Wiggum to knock them out and later cook their brains.
 In ""Barthood"", he, Dolph, and Kearney are seen at Milhouse's graduation party.
 In ""When Nelson Met Lisa"", he marries Sophie Krustofsky.
 Jimbo is loosely based on the character John Bender from The Breakfast Club. Jimbo is named for the Executive Producer, James L. Brooks. He is voiced by Pamela Hayden (Tress MacNeille in ""The Telltale Head"").
 In The Simpsons comics, Jimbo comes to school as ""James Jones."" Although James is referred to as ""Jimbo,"" that is not actually his real name.  
 .
 There is also the Super Wings characters with the same name.
 Jimbo is also known as a criminal in Rick &amp; Morty

Kearney Zzyzwicz,True,False,False,False,False,1,Smith,10,"Kearney Matthew Zzyzwicz, Sr. (dʒiːz.wɪtʃ) is one of the school bullies of Springfield Elementary, hanging around with Nelson Muntz, Dolph Starbeam, Jimbo Jones, and the Weasels. He is of Polish descent and is a fifth grader. A running gag is that Kearney is much older than all of the other kids at Springfield Elementary School but has been held back from graduating for many years.
 Kearney's surname was revealed in a computer file in the 399th episode ""24 Minutes"".    
 It is often drawn to the viewer's attention that Kearney is much older than any of the other children at Springfield Elementary, and moreover, he doesn't seem to be ashamed of it. One of his random Level-Up lines in Tapped Out suggests that Kearney remains in school simply because he can't be bothered to pass as he says school is an easy place to procrastinate. He has been seen shaving in the school restrooms, smokes, has a driver's license, and owns an old-style Hyundai - Principal Seymour Skinner once attempted to pry off Kearney's hood ornament to replace the 'H' stolen from Superintendent Chalmers' Honda. He's also on the Church Council (along with Marge Simpson, Ned Flanders, Agnes Skinner, Helen Lovejoy, and Jasper Beardsley) and considers it an important part of the community, and is a member of the NRA, attending their meetings and practicing on their range, so presumably he legally owns a gun.
 Being only 19 years old, Kearney is under the legal drinking age of 21 and requires a fake ID to buy booze. He was in the third grade with Otto Mann, and while Jimbo and Dolph finally managed to pass from the fifth grade into the sixth (just as Bart passed from the third into the fourth), Kearney has remained in the fifth grade and seems to have given up on ever passing.
 Another thing frequently drawn to attention is that Kearney has married, divorced, and had two sons, one of whom attends Springfield Elementary with him. Kearney once referred to himself as ""a teenager and the father of a teenager"", meaning that one of his sons is at least 13 years of age and implying that Kearney fathered this child at an extremely young age. Interestingly, before Kearney's status as a father was revealed, in Bart Gets an ""F"" it was Bart's nightmare that he would still be going to school with his sons. Kearney, however, seems to be okay with it. Regarding divorces, he also was shown to sympathize with those who were the victim in any way with a divorce, such as when expressing his condolences to Milhouse Van Houten when he learned that his parents had divorced.
 In The Simpsons: Tapped Out, Kearney mentions he has a son called Jason, and 'Kearney Jr' has not yet been named in the show.
 He has another possible son mentioned in the next episode ""Eeny Teeny Maya, Moe"".
 Kearney Jr. Kearney was once married, although his ex-wife has never been named or seen. The only details given were that he had to divorce her, because Kearney didn't want his parents to find out. Kearney has said that he misses having sex with her, although it also mentioned in one episode that Kearney dated Jimbo's mother in ""She of Little Faith"".
 Kearney at age 37. It was revealed that Kearney, Jimbo, and Dolph, were bullied by nerds. Bart then taught them that nerds are ""all talk and no action"" and they learned to ""stand up"" for themselves. Bart was later caught in the crossfire when his own creation backfired, and the other students at Springfield Elementary School (this is seen in a comic, but comic strips are not usually considered canonical).
 In ""Future-Drama"", at age 37, Kearney becomes the Vice-Principal of Springfield Elementary (the principal is still Seymour Skinner), however, his bullying traits seem to have finally left.
 Vice-Principal Kearney In ""Barthood"", at age 37, Kearney is upset that his son is graduating Kearney Zzyzwicz, Jr. tell to as they have his son.
 At age 59, he becomes Lisa's bodyguard when she becomes the president of the United States in ""Bart to the Future"", saying his contract gives him three people to kill in each term.
 At age 59, in ""Holidays of Future Passed"", he is a cab driver taking Maggie Simpson to her family when she went into labor. He chooses to take a pregnant Maggie to the hospital.
 At age 59, in ""Days of Future Future"", he, Jimbo, and Dolph, attempt to rob Lisa and Milhouse, but Milhouse fights them using Ralph Wiggum to knock them out and later cook their brains.
 Kearney was Hired with Jimbo and Dolph to steal artifacts from the Museum on their way they stop to take Milhouse's pants and then sees Kent and he says that he's been dating his daughter and gets their band wrong which gets them ticked off. Later, he warns Bart and Homer to stay away from the museum and steals, but fails and later can't believe that they beat him. He then tells Homer about the Eating Contest and says he's gonna win it. He then appears as one of the contestants in the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge. Later, he says in case of the Eating Contest, his overweight proved valuable. Kearney later gets Grand Theft Scratchy with Roams around the Streets of Springfield trying to stop Marge and Lisa who are trying to ban the Game and succeeds. He later watched the fight with Lard Lad and the Aliens and tells Homer that he guessed Lard Lad was a bigger Fatso then him and later questions if the Aliens could process how fat Homer is for a human. After the Game, Kearney could be seen talking to Dolph at the town's Square saying that next time he hopes they get invaded by Transformers and later foreshadows the Transformers in Treehouse of horror.
 Kearney appears as a character card you can collect.
 Kearney is unlocked in a Mystery Box. Classed as both a kid and a parent, he is a highly versatile character when performing missions with multiple character, frequently an option for missions requiring kids, but just as frequently an option for missions that require an adult and always an option for missions that require a parent. A great deal of his dialogue draws attention to still being in school, despite his age and parenthood.
 Kearney has a card in The Simpsons Classic Collection Volume Two.
 ""Kearney was shy and lonely as a young boy, until he realized that a great way to meet people was to beat them up. Now he knows lots of kids, and many adults. He is currently passing his knowledge on to his own young son, who he tutors in the fine art of smashing other kids' sandcastles."" Secret skill: Dances a jig to create diversions.
 Zombie Kearney also is a card in The Simpsons Horror Edition.
 ""Newly undead, Zombie Kearney can now look forward to repeating the fourth grade - forever. But it's not so bad. Principal Skinner's watchful eye and head make a brilliant football. And each new fourth grade class means a fresh crop of brains.""
 Kearney was created from ""Kearney Street"" in Portland, Oregon, where The Simpsons creator Matt Groening grew up.

Reverend Timothy Lovejoy,True,True,False,True,False,1,Shearer,11,"Reverend Timothy Goren Lovejoy Jr., better known as Rev. Lovejoy, is a recurring character on The Simpsons. He is the local Presbylutheran Minister in Springfield.
 Timothy Lovejoy Jr. once was a bible salesman and one day, he went to a small house on the prairie not too far from Springfield. He and the person who lived there with her parents, Helen Schwartzbaum, soon had a great bond. By force of habit, Helen accidentally spread a rumor about herself and Timothy Lovejoy, and they were forced to marry. Thankfully, it was just what they wanted. Later, he met his friend, Seminarian Gohan. 
 Reverend Timothy Lovejoy Jr. usually wears a bubblegum-colored shirt and a navy- or sky-blue tie or he wears his reverend collar with a black shirt and pants. When he is in Church or officiating weddings, he wears his reverend robe over his usual wear. Sometimes he wears it over his bubblegum shirt and sometimes over his black shirt and pants with his reverend collar. He has black hair and bags under his eyes, and he usually has his eyes half-lidded. Outside of his sermons, he usually will not wear standard clergy attire, but instead a suit which consists of his bubblegum shirt, tie and blue pants.
 Reverend Timothy Lovejoy Jr. is sometimes seen with an Episcopal Priest's cassock, while at the same time also wearing either his bubblegum shirt and tie or a Catholic Priest's black suit and clerical collar. He is a Man of God and a marriage counselor. Usually when holding counseling with others in his church when not giving his Sunday Sermons, Lovejoy will not wear the cassock and often wears the suit consisting of his bubblegum shirt and tie. He was trained to be a priest at Pepperdine, a catholic priest university.
 It is revealed that he may be friends with Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky because they do a radio show together about religion called Gabbin' about God. His biggest competitors are the NFL, warm beds on a Sunday morning, and cable.
 Despite the devotion Ned Flanders has long had to Christianity, Lovejoy at times found him to be annoying, even going as far to say ""Damn Flanders"" when Ned called him after Todd used the words ""damn vegetables"" and opting to play with his model trains rather than accept Ned's request to baptize the Simpsons children.
 He describes how he initially came to Springfield an eager, idealistic young man in the seventies, only to become cynical and disillusioned about his flock and ministry, mostly due to Ned Flanders, who constantly pesters him with such non-emergencies as coveting his own wife. Lovejoy would dispatch such concerns with maximum brevity so that he could return to playing with his model trains (his true passion), and in one case, his dessert. He wrote a book called Hell: It's Not Just for Christians Anymore and a pamphlet called Satan's Boners.
 Regarding his ministry, he once explained to Marge, ""I just stopped caring. Fortunately, by that time it was the eighties, and no one noticed."" Lovejoy demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the Bible, citing parables such as the ""foolish man who built his house on sand"" in an attempt to warn Homer against the dangers of founding a self-serving ""religion"". Homer retorts with a random passage of his own, which Lovejoy cites immediately as having no relevance to the discussion. Homer then tries in vain to cover himself by saying, ""Yeah ... think about it!""
 His sermons currently vary between dreary recitations of more opaque parts of the Old Testament, to the occasional ""fire and brimstone"" scaremongering about Hell — and very little of the love and joy that the Reverend's surname suggests. However, some of the sermons, such as the sin of Gambling, occur on weeks that are highly ironic, such as the fact that Reverend Lovejoy's anti-gambling sermon occurring on a week where Bingo is going to be played on Tuesdays, an implied Gambling convention called Monte Carlo night on Wednesday, and having a retreat at Reno, Las Vegas on Saturday. Lovejoy is also implied to be a closet drinker. Burns' Surveillance Room shows him drinking heavily from a flask. When congregation members begin to nod off, Lovejoy can awaken them by pressing a button on his lectern resulting in pre-recorded sounds, including an eagle, an ambulance siren, a disco whistle and a blimp attack. He has his dog do his ""dirty business"" on Ned Flanders' lawn.
 Lovejoy is depicted as the image of Christian tolerance and diligence within the town of Springfield. When he first became a reverend in the 1970s he was initially passionate and idealistic about helping people with their problems but as Springfield's citizens (namely Ned Flanders) began to pester him with trivial problems every day, Lovejoy lost enthusiasm and eventually stopped caring altogether (although no one seemed to observe this matter). 
 His own disinterest in his religion has caused his Sunday sermons to become a bleak monotone. Lovejoy seems aware of how much the townspeople hate his sermons but he continues to drone his delivery out further, quite frankly maliciously due to being embittered by how his enthusiasm was crushed, often finding passive-aggressive ways to spite the townsfolk, including pretending to conclude his sermon by stating ""a..."" then going onto another verse when they believed he was about to conclude ""amen"" in excitement and then took an exaggerated amount of time before really finishing, only doing it when Homer threatened him. He once repeated his entire sermon when near to the end upon noticing a ""few people"" were not paying attention, commanded his dog to defecate on Ned's front yard and even had the church choir sing Homer's song, Everybody Hates Ned Flanders, an entire song dedicated to slandering Ned.
 Lovejoy's faith in Christianity itself is rather dubious. His ideals and behavior of his own religion is also rather Draconian. His tendency to lead mass burnings, partake in mob rioting and his willingness to prosecute children, crucify and burn people show this. Lovejoy also has little tolerance for gays, opposite religion, or the descending opinion of evolution, shown by the way he refused to marry gay couples when same-sex marriage was legalized in Springfield and leading a slander attack on Darwin's theory of evolution with Ned Flanders. Lovejoy rarely gives meaningful advice to people who actually seek it, normally directing them to a bible verse that has no actual relevance to their own problem at hand. Moe claims that he became suicidal because Lovejoy rarely gave him encouragement that he had something to live for.
 He became so fed up with Flanders calling him that he attempted to sway him to a different religion, claiming ""they're all pretty much the same thing"". This lack of dedication was also witnessed by the way he threw his reverend collar when it seemed the Movementarians religious cult beliefs were actually true and only picked it up when pointed out by Ned and pretending it was an accident. He is implied to be money-hungry and previously burnt down his church for the insurance and regularly asks, at times demands, generous donations to the church collection plate. It is presumed however that whatever funds Lovejoy gains are used towards the church which is in shoddy condition.
 Despite his lack of enthusiasm, Lovejoy becomes deeply disturbed when he believes someone is leaving his branch of Christianity, as he went to great lengths to persuade Bart from becoming Catholic, and when the Simpson family became Movemanterians. When Homer refused to come to church anymore, Lovejoy gave a meaningful bible verse to persuade him to come back and led the town in prayer when Homer ""made God angry"" and was flooding Springfield. In ""In Marge We Trust"", he became saddened when his audience was paying more attention to Marge than him and finally spoke in a more passionate caress in his sermon when recalling how he rescued Ned from a school of vicious baboons.
 Lovejoy is an avid collector of model trains. However, his collection is usually ruined such as when one of his trains was derailed off its tracks whilst talking to Ned on the phone and when Homer plowed through his set, leading him to believe that God hated Lovejoy's trains. He also seems to have very little tolerance for the use of the word ""butt"" being used in front of him, or any similar-sounding word, as he threw Bart out of the house during a dinner date with his daughter Jessica because of Bart using that word, either not understanding or not caring if he, in fact, meant t
 
 His tolerant side is demonstrated when he performs a marriage for Hindus (though he apparently thinks Hinduism is a Christian group) and co-hosts a religious radio program with Krusty the Clown's rabbi father. However, despite the fact that he married a Hindu couple, he is unable to identify Apu's religion sometimes.
 At times, he has been shown to have a lack of empathy. His words of comfort to death-row inmates are ""Well, if that's the worst thing to happen to you today, consider yourself lucky"", specifically when Hans Moleman was unable to eat his last meal.
 At one point he claimed that all of the major religions are ""pretty much the same"", however, this was only because he wanted to get rid of Ned Flanders.
 However, Lovejoy has become increasingly intolerant. As such, his antagonism towards Ned Flanders has diminished in recent seasons. He called Lisa, who had converted to Buddhism, ""Marge Simpson's devil-daughter"". Moreover, he appears bitter about the tall Episcopal church across the street, wanting to build a larger steeple and, when mentioning the other church, placing the emphasis on ""pis"". He also read to Lisa an excerpt from the Bible to justify Whacking Day (during which many snakes are killed) but refused to show her the supposed text supporting his argument. While he seems to have originally believed in evolution, he later takes up the creationist cause to bolster his church's membership. He has also driven a ""Book-burning-mobile"", further revealing an extremist nature. He seems rather stingy and pessimistic as well. Similarly, when Krusty the Clown was framed for armed robbery, he led a burning of all Krusty merchandise.
 He is also anti-gay. In ""There's Something About Marrying"", when Springfield legalized gay marriage, Reverend Lovejoy called it sinful, despite Marge's protests.
 He is especially intolerant of the Roman Catholic Church as he is shown brawling with a priest, telling Marge that he might as well do a Voodoo dance for Abe Simpson when he asked him to give him the last rites, and helped kidnap Bart to keep him from converting to Catholicism.
 Despite being a clergyman, Lovejoy does not always follow the word of the Bible and has been shown to do things that would be considered sinful. Lovejoy has been understood to exploit his congregation for money, brawl with a Catholic priest, encourage his dog to foul Ned Flanders' lawn, told Moe he had little to live for, burned down his church for insurance money, and partakes in a gambling scheme in ""Sky Police"".
 Lovejoy is not always enthusiastic about The Bible and is often disparaging about its content and purpose, (""Have you ever really read this thing? Technically, we're not allowed to go to the bathroom."") this most likely means that he believes it is impossible or very hard to be completely free of sin. At one point he refers to the Bible as a ""2000-page sleeping pill"". He tends to stress church and community work over any involved study of biblical text. He is also annoyed by Helen’s ranting and gossiping and scolded Helen for mocking Marge in ""El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer"" (although he has been shown to gossip in ""The Father, the Son and the Holy Guest Star"" when the waitress criticizes their lack of tips).
 He is proven to be a poor parent; he is usually seen spending more time with his wife and hobbies rather than with his daughter Jessica, who he sends to boarding school for the majority of the time. Because of this, Jessica has resorted to theft and smoking for attention.
 Also, he has been known to be somewhat enthusiastic about burnings, as evidenced by the fact that he owns a van which sole purpose is to burn books (named the burning-bookmobile), which he thanked Lisa personally for writing the article that inspired him  and his declaration that his entire parish, as well as the entire town, try to burn Krusty the Clown products after it was believed that he committed an armed robbery at the Kwik-E-Mart. This is a negative quality because the Christian Faith denounces any burnings in regards to objects, regardless of whether they are satanic in origin or not. This trait of his also has passed beyond into his personal behavior; he also had deliberately set his church on fire several times to gain the insurance money covered with the repairs.
 It is no secret that he hates Homer. He even wanted Marge to leave him, but Marge refuses to do it. Lovejoy usually tells everyone that Homer is horrible and even wrote ""Jesus Died For This!"" Picture of Homer sleeping in church. However, he has shown to be patient with Homer in some episodes, such as when he, Homer and Apu thought that one of their wives were going to leave with Moe, they tried to think about how they were treating their wives recently.
 Reverend Lovejoy's daughter Jessica is normally ignored by her father who refuses to believe she is worse than Bart even after she stole the church's donations. He also does not care that Jessica is a bully and smokes cigarettes.
 Lovejoy's wife, Helen, who looks about the same age as her husband, is a moralistic gossip. Now Helen is rarely seen without being at her husband's side. Despite the 1950s aura, it is she, not her husband, who is the driver of the van that takes the Lovejoys out of town when Homer Simpson is deeded the church by the court after suing them for falling in a hole outside the church building and ends up bringing the wrath of God upon Springfield, which is allayed only by the Lovejoys' return.
 Reverend Lovejoy's father has appeared once, in Springfield's burlesque house, La Maison Derrière.
 Lovejoy also has a bad relationship with his mother in law and mentioned that after Helen's father passed away, she never stopped visiting.
 Timothy and Helen have a stronger marriage than many other Springfieldians (save for Ned and Maude, and probably Dr. Hibbert). Many couples turned to divorce (Kirk and Luann Van Houten) or consistently argue, bear many kids, and have trouble with money (Cletus and Brandine Spuckler); however, Helen is somewhat patient of Timothy. Once Timothy spends more time on his own and slowly loses his mind, but Helen remains patient, however worried. In ""In Marge We Trust"" we see the bravery it took Helen, who is doesn't like showing vulnerability, to be able to swallow her pride, push through the awkwardness and ask her greatest rival, Marge Simpson, for help about her husband's mental health. This shows just how much Helen loves her husband. Helen once mentions her mother is going to visit them and Timothy makes an insult saying that after Helen's father died, her mother visits them too much. However, once when her daughter, Jessica Lovejoy was running down the field to shoot a soccer goal. Helen yelled, ""Get it in, sweetie, and save our troubled marriage!""
 In ""Lisa's Wedding"", he is minster for Lisa Simpson's and Hugh Parkfield's wedding.
 In ""Days of Future Future"", he is minster for Homer Simpson's many funerals.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" segment Homer³ Lovejoy provides solace saying Homer would be in a better after he gets trapped in the third dimension.
 In the final scene of ""Treehouse of Horror VIII"", he speaks to the mob about having done the Lord's work after Marge is pushed off the cliff but is interpreted when Marge flies upon a broomstick revealing herself as a witch.
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror X"", he is the minister of Ned Flanders' funeral. 
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XXVII"", he is the minister for the funeral of Janey, Sherri and Terri.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XXVIII "" segment The Exor-sis, after Ned Flanders suggests an exorcism to cure Maggie and looks pointedly at Lovejoy, he says ""I'm afraid they didn't teach me those at Pepperdine.""
 Matt Groening has indicated that Reverend Lovejoy is named after NW Lovejoy Street in Portland, Oregon (the city where Groening grew up), which is in turn named for Portland co-founder Asa Lovejoy.

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,True,False,False,True,True,1,Azaria,12,"Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Jr., also known as Apu Du Beaumarchais, Slime Q. Slimedog and Steve Barnes, is the operator of the Kwik-E-Mart. He is a recurring character in The Simpsons. He is an immigrant from India, and as such, speaks with a strong Indian accent. Accounts disagree as to whether he is a college dropout or if he has a PhD.
 Apu's wedding with Manjula During the 1960s, while still living in India, Apu spent some time as a student of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in which capacity he became a friend of Paul and Linda McCartney. Apu's friendship with the McCartneys caused him to be referred to by some (mainly himself) as ""The Fifth Beatle"".
 His education history is contradictory. Once, he said he graduated from Caltech (the Calcutta Technical Institute), where he was the top of his class of 7,000,000 pupils and got a scholarship in the United States at the Springfield Heights Institute of Technology shortly after. Once in the United States, he achieved a doctorate in Computer Science by designing the world's first tic-tac-toe program that only the top human players could beat (which was broken by Bart years later). He then took a job working at the Kwik-E-Mart to repay his student loan.
 In another account, he said he attended MIT (the Mumbai Institute of Tantric Sex) and used the money he won from a card-counting ring there to purchase fake SAT scores and get into the real MIT. Apu failed every class, was kicked out, and had to move to Springfield.
 During the mid-1980s, Apu was a member of the barbershop quartet called The Be Sharps, which also consisted of Homer Simpson, Seymour Skinner, and Barney Gumble, who replaced original band member Chief Clancy Wiggum. Upon the advice of Nigel, the band's manager, Apu took the stage name Apu du Beaumarche and denied ""by the many arms of Vishnu"" that he was actually a Hindu.
 Apu and Manjula married after two years, despite trying to wriggle out of the situation. He was won over soon after meeting Manjula and the pair actually did fall in love. Later, Manjula gave birth to octuplets after receiving a larger-than-recommended dose of fertility drugs. Apu and Manjula have a mostly happy marriage, despite understandable marital problems caused by Apu's workaholic nature, the stress of caring for eight children, and two instances of infidelity by Apu. He and his family are devotees of the Hindu gods Shiva, Ganesha, and Vishnu. At Apu's wedding, Homer, in a misguided attempt to play on the bride and groom's families' fear of the gods, arrived dressed as the Hindu god Ganesh. The impersonation was seen through by one of Apu's relatives and failed miserably. Before getting married, Apu became known as the leading ladies' man in Springfield, because he holds a Ph.D. and runs his own business. He also admitted, ""I'm not much of a talker, but I love to listen. I also like to design and build furniture and then to have a discussion about where it could be placed in a room,"" which made the single women of Springfield go crazy for him. Despite his hectic marriage and home life, however, his first love is still to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, sometimes taking shifts long enough to send him into sleep-deprived hallucinations in which he thinks he is ""...a hummingbird of some kind."" Also, after Apu had an affair with Annette, Manjula made him legally change his name to Slime Q Slimedog. He is revealed to have slept with Selma Bouvier after Homer and Marge's second wedding.
 Apu in Yahtzee He claims to know Pi to 40000 decimal places, noting that the last place (40001st digit of pi) is one (yet the true 40,001st digit is a 6).

 Apu is generally polite towards his customers, always saying thank you, even after less-than-genial interactions with the public, such as armed hold-ups. He is also a dutiful worker to the point of being a virtual workaholic, spending so much time awake at one point he began to believe he was a hummingbird. He is often found spending more time at his workplace than even with his own family, to Manjula's irritation, especially when she finds out that in America, workplaces normally have weekends off, a practice that Apu evidently never told her. It is also implied in the show, and confirmed in one of the Bongo Comics, that Apu's workaholic nature grew more severe after his marriage to Manjula and his becoming the father of octuplets, viewing his stressful home-life as a reason to continue working extensively at Kwik-E-Mart. Apu is also vegan, refusing to eat either animal meat or even ""anything that comes from an animal.""
 However, he has some negative traits, shown throughout the course of the show. His hard work ethic and though loyal attitude notwithstanding, Marge in Chains shows him ruthlessly prosecuting Marge Simpson over a misplaced and absentmindedly forgotten bottle of bourbon, and to even where he refuses the pleas of Homer for him to drop the unjustified shoplifting charges and the trial for the sake of the reputation of security company joint sponsor of Kwik-E-Mart's, Nordyne Defense Dynamics. Apu's antics with the Squishy Woman also highlights his infidelity that comes with his workaholic mentality.
 In some episodes, Apu is even seen manipulating customers into buying things they don't really need (sometimes into things which may be potentially life-threatening and even fatal), and at exorbitantly jacked up prices. He also sometimes slips some snideness in his polite greetings. He has a bit of a paranoid nature, as evidenced by him once jumping behind a counter and then shouting threats to Bart and Lisa who were walking in to investigate a robbery at the Kwik-E-Mart, and on at least two occasions went up to the roof and started firing a rifle at potential customers. Apu is also not immune to practicing the customary traits of Springfieldians, being backwardness, myopia, and even to outright stupidity, having been seen flocking to various questionable trends and to even participate in various mobbings.
 It is implied in a few episodes that Apu may have some nudist inclinations, as, aside from a brief publicity stunt where he made the Kwik-E-Mart have a clothing-optional policy, he at one point while extremely drunk from the Saint Patrick's Day Parade declared in a bullhorn for everyone to ""get naked"" and tried to entice the crowd by stating to not be ""stuck up"" as it will be great, and when entering international waters, he was briefly seen dancing naked on Mr. Burns' yacht.

 In addition to being Brahmins, Apu and Manjula appear to be South Indian, because of their last names and darker complexions. The name Apu means ""loving child"" in the Tamil language. However, Apu has also been shown to be Bengali, although Apu got his name from The Apu Trilogy, which is in Bengali. However, Manjula speaks Hindi, the national language of India (interpreted as ""baby talk"" by Marge), to Maggie, as opposed to Tamil or Bengali, further complicating the debate. Still, Apu's parents very strongly appear to be Tamil. Apu has a cousin named Kavi, who lives in Bangalore, which is part of Karnataka, South India; which would imply that they are actually Kannadigas. His possible universities were either in Calcutta (Kolkata) or Mumbai, which are on different sides of India and have differing primary languages.
 All American Apu Apu was an illegal alien whose student visa expired, as he wished to pay off his student debts in full before moving back to India. By the time this happened, he made so many friends he decided to stay. He later became a naturalized US citizen.
 Sanjay, Apu's brother, helps him run the Kwik-E-Mart. Sanjay's daughter (and Apu's niece) is Pahusacheta. Sanjay's son is Jay. They all share the Nahasapeemapetilon surname. Apu has another younger brother, Tikku, who is mentioned in two episodes. When Apu's and Manjula's parents were first arranging their marriage, Apu was shown as the oldest of three on a chart. Apu also has a cousin living in India named Kavi, who helped Homer when he visited India. He works for many American companies taking service calls and can speak with American, Western, and Jamaican accents.
 Due to his job at the Kwik-E-Mart and it frequently being a target for robbery, he has frequently ended up being shot and having to go to the hospital. He had been shot enough times that when Springfield held a town meeting for what to do with $3mil they got from a lawsuit from Mr Burns after the latter was caught dumping nuclear waste in a park, Apu suggested using it to train more competent cops and adding security to the Kwik-E-Mart, citing his being shot on the job multiple times as a reason. Despite not liking being shot, however, he did at least have some attachment to it, as after taking a bullet for James Woods after a robber tried to shoot him, he expressed nostalgia for being shot before telling Woods he might be dying. Ironically, his past instances of being shot actually saved him from that shooting, as one lodged-in bullet managed to block that particular bullet from doing fatal damage to his heart.
 Apu has been a playable character in several Simpsons games. He is the only non-Simpson family playable character in the video game The Simpsons: Hit and Run, and his standard vehicle is a yellow version of his Pontiac Firebird called ""Longhorn"". He is in the fifth level which is downtown Springfield at night, where he tries to find the source of Buzz Cola and, with Bart Simpson, uncovers the alien reality TV show that has fueled many of the game's events.
 He is also a driver and passenger in The Simpsons Road Rage and is a fighter unlocked from the beginning in The Simpsons Wrestling.
 In The Simpsons Game when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are assigned by Skinner to rob from the museum. They stop by the Kwik E Mart and Apu witnesses them take Milhouse's pants by force. Later when Bart and Homer save and destroy part of the museum Apu tells them that thanks to them his children will one day know the boredom of the museum. Apu later tells Bart that Springfields Fattest Pigs are signing up for the Duff Eating Contest. After the Contest Apu tells Bart way to give Homer an unfair advantage in the Eating Contest. Later when Mr. Burns is planning to cut down the forest he goes to the Kwik E Mart and buys a Magazine called GEO and leaves without buying it. After the foil of Mr. Burns's plan, Apu says to Bart saving a forest will assure he will be at least a pigeon in his next life. Apu later joins Marge to ban the Itchy and Scratchy Game and succeeds. When the Aliens invade Springfield, Apu sees the Mall being attacked by Aliens. Apu later heard on the Radio that Dolphins are attacking Springfield and wishes that his Donuts do not join the Lard Lad Reign of terror. Apu tells Bart that in honor of his victory he is serving Dolphin Flavored Squishies. He tells Bart that he really showed Lard Lad who's boss. He then thanks Bart for putting a small dent in the aliens' plan.
 Although he did not appear fully in person in The Simpsons' sister show, Futurama, his head could be seen in the head museum in ""Space Pilot 3000"" and ""Bender's Big Score"".
 In The Simpsons/Family Guy crossover Apu meets the Griffins and welcomes them to the Kwik-E-Mart. Later, Apu is seen being tortured by Stewie Griffin, despite but not being Bart's enemy Stewie just wanted to say he took ""a poo"".
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror VIII"" segment, The HΩmega Man Apu becomes a mutant after the French bomb Springfield for making an offensive joke.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror IX"" segment Hell Toupée Snake Jailbird murders Apu as revenge for Snake being executed by shoving him into his own Squishee machine.
 In second segment ""Treehouse of Horror XX"", Apu rescues the Simpsons who is uninfected due to his vegetarianism and the fact that, as a store clerk, he has weapons stocked, while his wife is seen as a muncher, and his octuplets might be munchers, to arrives in an armored SUV, driving the family out of Springfield. While driving their way to the ""safe zone"", Helen Lovejoy attacks the car and, though initially reluctant because Helen is Lisa's godmother, Marge relents and shoots her off of the car after Apu tells Helen to ""Apologize in Hell!"" However, the SUV gets stuck in a pile of junk at the city dump. Apu sends the vehicle on its way by pushing it down the pile, unintentionally staying behind as he gets devoured (because Marge thinks that he gave his life for them).
 In the first segment ""Treehouse of Horror XXIV"", when Bart, Lisa, and Maggie complain about wanting candy Fat in the Hat holds Apu at gunpoint, while the children take all the candy. Fat then forces Apu to spend more time with his family.
 In ""Future-Drama"", he gives Bart a job at the Kwik-E-Mart and instructs Bart to make a delivery to Mr. Burns.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", Apu and The Nahasapeemapetilon Octuplets stop Snake Jailbird from robbing a Kwik-E-Mart. Later, Marge visits him, Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon visits him The Nahasapeemapetilon Octuplets' Octuplets after the children all start crying and screaming. After Marge shuts the door Apu then tends to a dead cow which keeps telling its not (Sanjay) him, he has mistaken as the reincarnation of his brother Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon.
 Apu was voiced by Hank Azaria, who, owing to the character's Indian origins, voiced him with a Hindi accent.
 Apu's surname, Nahasapeemapetilon, is an anagram of the name Pahasanee Mapetilon, which are the first and last names of a schoolmate of Simpsons writer Jeff Martin.
 Apu's backstory in ""Sky Police"" about being a card counter in university, parodies a real-world MIT card counting blackjack team, which was dramatized in the 2008 film 21.
 Apu has had four action figures in the World of Springfield line. There is also an Apu figure in the Kidrobot figure line.
 In May 2014, LEGO released a Minifigure Series based on The Simpsons. It included 16 characters from the series, Apu was one of them.
 In 2015, as part of LEGO The Simpsons theme, a set based on the Kwik-E-Mart was released. It included a variant of Apu wearing his Kwik-E-Mart uniform.
 It has been argued that the portrayal of Apu is a racist caricature. During the 7-Eleven promotion in 2007, some members of the Indian-American community voiced concerns that Apu is a caricature that plays on too many negative stereotypes. Despite this, 7-Eleven reported that many of its Indian employees reacted positively to the idea, but noted that it was ""not a 100 percent endorsement"".
 According to comedian Hari Kondabolu, in a Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell web exclusive segment, there is a negative reaction to Apu in the Indian American community, as well as the greater South Asian diaspora community. Pakistani-American comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani has also criticized the character, and has related that early in his career, he was asked to do the ""Apu accent"" as a stereotypical version of the ""Indian accent"". In a 2007 interview, Azaria (who is of Sephardic Jewish descent) acknowledged some of this criticism when he recalled a conversation with the writers of the show during the inception of the character: ""Right away they were like 'Can you do an Indian accent and how offensive can you make it?' basically. I was like, 'It's not tremendously accurate. It's a little, uh, stereotype,' and they were like, 'Eh, that's all right.'"" In a 2013 interview with the Huffington Post, Azaria said it should not be expected that the character's accent would ""suddenly change now"" or that the character would be written out, saying, ""I'd be surprised if  write him any less frequently because he's offensive.""
 In 2016, Kondabolu announced his intention to produce a documentary about ""how this controversial caricature was created, burrowed its way into the hearts and minds of Americans and continues to exist – intact – twenty-six years later."" In 2017, Kondabolu released the hour-long documentary The Problem with Apu. In the film, Kondabolu interviews other actors and comics of South Asian heritage about the impact that the character of Apu has had on their lives and the perception of South Asians in American culture.
 On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Azaria said that he would be ""perfectly willing to step aside"" from the role of voicing Apu, saying that he was increasingly worried about the character causing harm by reinforcing stereotypes and that ""the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it ... I really want to see Indian, South Asian writers in the writers' room, genuinely informing whichever direction this character takes."" Kondabolu had a positive reaction to Azaria's comments.
 Despite the controversy around the character, some Indians and Indian Americans do like the character, even with these latter making parody and satire videos mocking the controversy around Apu and Azaria.
 The Simpsons episode ""No Good Read Goes Unpunished"", first aired on April 8, 2018, was widely received as a response to Kondabolu's film.
 In it, Marge finds that a book she loved as a child contains elements that would now be considered offensive, and edits the book herself to remove these elements. In doing this she finds the book loses its ""emotional journey"". She and Lisa then look to a picture of Apu, and Lisa comments that ""something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive, is now politically incorrect. What can you do?"" Kondabolu wrote on Twitter that he was disappointed that the message of his film had been reduced to the concept of ""politically incorrect"".
 In an interview with USA Today, creator Matt Groening dismissed the criticism of the Apu character, saying, ""I think it’s a time in our culture where people love to pretend they’re offended"". Dana Walden, the CEO of the 20th Century Fox Television, said in an August 2018 interview in regards to the Apu controversy that the network trusts the showrunners ""to handle it in the way that’s best for the show"".
 On October 26th, 2018, it was rumored that the show's producers, following the heated controversy surrounding the character’s stereotyping, would remove Apu from the show entirely. Hank Azaria had been previously been quoted as saying that he was fine with stepping away from the character. 
 Al Jean later dismissed the rumor as being not true.
 In early 2020, Azaria announced that he was stepping away from the Apu character, primarily because of the stereotypes and bias it perpetuated.
 In March 2021, Matt Groening is planning to bring back Apu with new stories, and says that he is working on something ambitious for the character. Since Azaria stepped away from voicing Apu, Groening is still looking for a voice actor.  
 In April 2021, Hank Azaria apologized to every Indian for voicing Apu.

Sideshow Bob,True,False,False,True,True,1,Grammer,13,"Dr. Robert Onderdonk ""Bob"" Terwilliger, Jr., more commonly recognized by his stage name, Sideshow Bob, is a recurring antagonist in The Simpsons. He was originally Krusty the Clown's sidekick, before starting a life of crime that began with an attempt to frame Krusty for armed robbery. Bob is a self-proclaimed genius, member of the Republican Party, champion of high culture, former children's entertainer-turned-criminal mastermind and Bart Simpson's nemesis. He loves operettas, the likes of Gilbert and Sullivan, and is also known for his gigantic feet, which have gotten him into trouble on more than one occasion.
 Robert Terwilliger (aka Sideshow Bob) began his career as ""Sideshow Bob"", a non-speaking sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show. His younger brother, Cecil, was actually the one who was auditioning for the role, which Krusty was not impressed by and saw Bob as the ideal comic foil who would be ridiculous and never stand him up. Sideshow Bob endured much as it was to be expected from being clown sidekicks, such as being targeted with pies and shot out of cannons, but Krusty took on a more sadistic bent in order to get laughs, which had been shown to be a habit of doing to other sidekicks of his. Sideshow Bob soon began to tire of these antics, and also realized that off-camera Krusty was engaging in vulgar behavior such as illegal gambling and patronizing strip joints. Fed up with enduring abuse in order to make money to fund Krusty's carnal appetites, Sideshow Bob began plotting Krusty's downfall.
 Fed up with Krusty's torment, Bob disguised himself as Krusty and framed him for an armed robbery of the Kwik-E-Mart. After Krusty was arrested, Bob takes control of the show, introducing children to elements of high culture. However, Bob's reign is short-lived; Bart Simpson, with the help of his sister, Lisa, exposes Bob's treachery and Krusty is released. Bart, with Lisa's help, was able to catch Bob mainly because Bob's large feet actually filled out Krusty's clown shoes, so when his foot was stepped on in the security footage, he felt it and yelped. Had it actually been Krusty committing the robbery, he would not have felt his foot being stepped on (or he may have worn normal shoes to aid in his getaway). Bart and Lisa also knew that Krusty had a pacemaker and in the security footage Bob used the microwave, which the real Krusty could not do because it would interfere with his pacemaker. Finally, Krusty was illiterate, and Bob was reading a magazine in the Kwik-E-Mart right before committing the robbery. After the new evidence was brought forward, Bob was subsequently convicted for the robbery and sent to jail, but not before swearing vengeance on Bart.
 Bob performing H.M.S. Pinafore for Bart. During his time in prison, Bob won an Emmy Award for his role on The Krusty the Clown Show, but his award was confiscated by the prison guards. Bob took part in a prisoner dating service and went into a relationship with Selma Bouvier, Bart's aunt. He also took some satisfaction in making nameplates for cars during this time since it allowed him to make subtle threatening messages against Bart. After he was released from prison, he proposed and married Selma, despite Bart's protests. As part of a scheme to inherit the money she has invested in the stock market, Bob attempted to kill Selma by blowing up their hotel room during their honeymoon. However, Bart again foiled the plan and Sideshow Bob returns to prison, exclaiming that as soon as the Democrats were back in office, he and all his criminal buddies would be back on the streets. Ironically, he would run as a Republican in a later episode to ""brutalize criminals"".
 Sideshow Bob tries to kill Bart Simpson. After being paroled from prison, Bob targeted Bart directly, threatening him repeatedly. His first attempt at threatening Bart involved mailing dozens of threatening letters written in Bob's own blood (only one of the letters was not actually written by Sideshow Bob, written in a sloppy, grammatically incorrect manner and obviously not being written in blood, which was instead written by Homer as revenge for Bart tattooing his butt with ""Wide Load""), which also caused him some health problems due to blood loss. The letters led Bart to become extremely paranoid. Bob eventually managed to get parole due to manipulating the Parole Jury with his intellect and cultured nature. He then unveiled his release to the Simpsons family in a movie theater and then proceeded to declare all the people he won't be killing, making sure to leave Bart off the list. His actions forced the Simpsons to move to Terror Lake with the identity of the Thompsons as part of the Witness Relocation Program. Bob, however, anticipated their relocation and followed them to their new houseboat, although the actual journey proved painful for Bob, having his head hit repeatedly by speed bumps, being scalded by coffee Homer threw out of the car, and being subject to cacti after the family decided to drive through the cactus patches, and then after getting out of the car, constantly hitting rakes. He eventually encountered Bart underneath another car but ended up losing his quarry due to the arrival of a parade celebrating Hannibal crossing the Alps, complete with elephants, although not without Bart noticing his presence. Eventually, he, after infiltrating the houseboat and subduing the family, prepared to kill Bart. He allows a final request, however, and Bart asks to hear the entire score of H.M.S. Pinafore. This delaying tactic leads to Bob's third arrest.
 Bob was released from prison once again after conservative commentator Birch Barlow convinced the public that Bob was a political prisoner. After being released, he ran for Mayor of Springfield on a Republican Party ticket. He won the election against liberal incumbent Joe Quimby by a landslide. He then used his power as mayor to propose the demolition of the Simpsons house to make way for an Expressway and sent Bart back to kindergarten. Bart and Lisa later discover that Bob rigged the election, and then manipulated him into confessing after implying he was simply a patsy, leading to another incarceration.
 Bob for mayor During his prison sentence, he began to develop a growing dislike of television, calling it ""an omnidirectional sludge pump, droning and burping"". While doing community service at an Air Force Base before an annual air show, Bob escaped from his work duty and sneaks into a hangar in the base disguising his voice with the mannerisms of Col. Leslie ""Hap"" Hapablap, where he made off with a nuclear device. During the air show, coincidentally being attended by the Simpsons family, Bob appeared on the television screens and threatened to blow up Springfield with a nuclear bomb unless the city stops broadcasting all television shows. When confronted by Bart and Lisa, the bomb is discovered to be a dud, and Sideshow Bob instead kidnaps Bart and hijacks the Wright Flier, planning to crash the Flier onto a shack where Krusty was broadcasting an impromptu TV show. However, the plan fails, and Bob returned to prison.
 Bob is released from prison Bob's ""funeral"" During yet another prison sentence, Bob became a member of the prison's Christian outreach program and tried to be genuinely redeemed. Reverend Lovejoy declared him a changed man and recommended him for a work release opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of his brother Cecil, who was Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. Though Bart constantly investigated him and his job at the dam still made him show signs of bitterness and resentment, he tried to be a good man. However, the scheming Cecil, still sulking over his failed audition for Krusty, tried to frame Bob by sabotaging the Springfield Dam. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stopped Cecil and saved the town. However, both brothers were sent to prison despite Bob's genuine innocence due to chief Clancy Wiggum's steadfast insistence about Bob's culpability despite all contrary testimony from Bart and Lisa.
 Bart under Bob's hypnotic spell When Krusty announces his retirement due to low ratings, Bob discovered from prison that Krusty has erased all of the early shows featuring Sideshow Bob. Bob is released from prison and developed a plot to kill Krusty. Using his new job as an intercom announcer at Springfield Elementary, he corners Bart in a shack off the school playground and hypnotizes Bart, planning to use him as a suicide bomber during Krusty's final retirement show. However, when he overhears Krusty express regret about mistreating him, Bob decides to abort his plan, and although he is returned to prison for attempted murder, Krusty thanks him due to the fact that his show's ratings sore back up every time Bob tries to kill him. Sideshow Bob, as a result of his attempted murder, was also originally going to be executed by the Guillotine, but Bob reminded Chief Wiggum that he was supposed to get a trial before committing the execution, causing it to be revoked and spend time in jail. At some point, he also participated in Marge's prison art class and ended up having a papier-mâché sculpt being done on his own face for unknown reasons.
 After a murder attempt is made on Homer Simpson's life, Bob was temporarily released from prison to help find the culprit, much to the dismay and horror of Bart. To keep him from trying to hurt Bart, the police attach a shock garter to Bob's leg and gives the family a remote that shocks Bob at the push of the button, which proves effective. However, the family, mainly Bart, misuse the remote, shocking Bob just for being too smart. During the course of the case, Bob actually saved Homer after an attempt on his life. When the mystery is solved, he returned to the Simpsons home to murder Bart. However, Bob found that he was ""accustomed to Bart's face"" and cannot do it. Bob did not return to prison and decided to move to Italy in order to make a fresh start. After gaining fame for his wine (his exceptionally large feet made him a perfect grape crusher), he became the mayor of the town. He married a local woman named Francesca, with whom he has a son named Gino.
 The Simpson family encountered him by chance after coming to Italy to retrieve a car for Mr. Burns. Bob welcomes them with hospitality on the condition that they do not reveal his felonious past; however, a drunken Lisa jokes about Bob's criminal deeds, eventually exposing Bob's past and causing Bob to be alienated from his citizens. He, his wife and son swear a vendetta on the Simpsons.
 Bob and his father and brother Bob runs for mayor In a later attempt on Bart's life, Bob lured the Simpsons family into a fake rib restaurant, and tied the entire family up, planning to kill them with the explosion of an overheating laptop next to a pile of TNT. After Bob misquoted several lines on Shakespeare, Lisa managed to trick him into checking a line from a Shakespeare play on Wikipedia, resulting in the laptop exploding on his hands. During the trial, Bob's father, Robert Terwilliger, Sr., testified on the stand, explaining that Bob had a rare heart condition, and also suggests that Sideshow Bob is insane because of his long-standing feud with Bart. This convinced Springfield that in the long-run Bart is ultimately to blame, and they turn against him. As Bart pleads his innocence, Bob takes out a vial labeled nitroglycerin, which Bart snatches and throws out the window, thinking it was an explosive. The vial was actually Bob's heart medication and he collapsed on the floor, unconscious, and was pronounced dead. In reality, Bob was actually faking his death and put in a temporary death-like state, as his father injected him with an anesthesia. His entire family was assisting him to kill Bart. When a guilty Bart visits his coffin while being led by Cecil, Bob leaped out of the coffin and trapped Bart inside to be cremated inside the coffin. The Simpsons family saves Bart just in time by blinding Bob with unclaimed ashes. Bob's entire family, including his Italian wife and child, and his brother and parents, were sentenced to an 87-year prison term, and Bob was put in a straitjacket.
 Sideshow Bob: the mayor of a small Italian town, in The Italian Bob Sideshow Bob was briefly seen escaping from prison and visited Krusty the Clown for the week. Bart and Lisa traced Sideshow Bob to a cabin believing that he has kidnapped Homer Simpson (Homer went missing at Marge's third wedding and thought Sideshow Bob was the culprit due to a clue, a keychain with the letters ""SB"" on it, being left in the groom's room.), only to discover that he was actually trying to aerate a bust of Krusty that he was sculpting. Krusty also explains that Sideshow Bob couldn't have kidnapped Homer Simpson because Bob was with Krusty the whole day. When Lisa questions him about the key chain, he explains that, although it's nice that they thought of him, the initials don't just pertain to him, and gives a list of people whom ""SB"" could refer to, including Selma Bouvier, the actual culprit. Eventually, he returns to jail again (exactly how is never explained), where he is bullied by Snake.
 Later, the town of Springfield releases all minor offenders from the Springfield prison as a result of budget cuts. Sideshow Bob performs plastic surgery on his new cellmate, Walt Warren, one such offender, switching their faces (which he did in order to be released from prison early, as Walt, so he can kill Bart). He then buys the house next to the Simpsons, planning to pose as their friendly neighbor while waiting for the chance to kill Bart. However, while this disguise does fool the rest of the Simpsons, Bart easily sees through it, immediately recognizing Bob's distinctive voice. Bob then planned to take Bart over to the Five Corners so he could kill Bart in one state while standing in another state, so that it would be legal for him to kill Bart. However, the real Walt manages to foil his plan and the police from all five states trap him. It is revealed he has been given back his normal face when he later speaks briefly during the town meeting to exile the Simpson family, and later on, when he attempts to kill Bart while in New York City, only to be hit by a train. Bart also assumed his identity on an online poker game. Bob was later seen during Bart Simpson's trial, assuming the mantle of one of the ""Unfriendly Witnesses"".
 While still serving out his sentence at Springfield Penitentiary, Sideshow Bob was recruited as a human test subject by Monsarno Corporation. His original purpose was to ensure that the experiments wouldn't be too painful for the test monkeys. After publishing the results of the tests he was subjected to, he eventually rose up the ranks to become Chief Scientist at the Monsarno Research Campus, where he created over 5000 patents. One day, the Simpson family visits the lab to learn more about genetically modified organisms and are shocked to find Sideshow Bob working there. Bob swears that he has changed and that he truly is working to make a better world. During their visit, Lisa learns that she and Bob share a common passion for Walt Whitman, poetry, and art. Believing that a mind that thinks so much like hers could not possibly be completely evil, she begins visiting Bob at the campus on a regular basis. Eventually, Monsarno Corporation allows Bob an hour of freedom to spend with Lisa at the Springfield Metropolitan Museum. While there, a Calder Mobile almost falls on Lisa, but Bob saves her by catching the mobile and throwing it aside. When Lisa demands to know how Bob got the strength to lift the massively heavy sculpture, Bob confesses that he had been altering his DNA to give himself various superhuman abilities. Further, he admits that he had only come to the museum to collect DNA from the personal effects of famous historical persons (such as George Washington, Albert Einstein, and Florence Nightingale) and splicing them with his own so that he might become a superhuman dictator. Eventually, Bart shows up at the museum and Bob is provoked to attack the Simpson children, due to DNA from Zombie Ant Fungus. During the chase scene that follows, Bob demonstrates the abilities of grasshopper-like leaping, sonar, and cranial kinesis. He eventually corners the children at the Springfield Dam and intends to throw them off of it. However, when Lisa recites a quote by Whitman, Bob finally realizes what kind of person he has become and attempts suicide by leaping from the dam himself. He survives on account of having given himself gills.
 Sideshow Bob kidnapped by Stewie Griffin When Krusty's father dies, Bob makes a brief appearance at the funeral reception to offer his condolences to Krusty (exactly how he was captured or if his abilities have been removed is never explained). He is then confronted by a drunken Sideshow Mel, who reveals that Krusty is always telling him that he will never live up to Bob's comedic genius. Mel goes on to say that all of Krusty's sidekicks have thought about killing him.
 Bob also has a brief cameo in the Simpsons/Family Guy crossover episode, as one of many of Bart's enemies that Stewie Griffin kidnaps and tortures.
 Later, Bob meets Jack Lassen, a sociopath who took a job as a prison guard at Springfield Penitentiary after Bart gets him fired from his job as the new fourth-grade teacher at Springfield Elementary. Realizing that they both share a deep hatred of Bart Simpson, Lassen offers to break Bob out of prison so they can team up and take their revenge on the boy together. Bob ultimately rejects the deal as he does not want to have to take turns gutting Bart.
 Bob later did community service, although his hard work was wasted when the Simpson family destroyed the garbage by running into it via their rental car. After learning that Bart went missing, Bob volunteered alongside his other prison inmates and Shaquille O'Neal to find Bart, obviously, so he could try to kill him. After hearing that Bart was dead, he had trouble believing it, with his doubts being confirmed when Bart called the Simpson family and confirming he is alive. Bob then forces Milhouse to show them where Bart was located (being the only one who found the manhole Bart fell into). Predictably, he then shoves Milhouse down the manhole and prepares to use the military missile bunker's missiles to do away with his nemesis. However, he ultimately had a change of heart and spared them, presumably also bringing him to the surface. Bob subsequently returned to prison and underwent psychiatric help. At some point afterward, he underwent parole again, and eventually joined a Santa union at Santa's Village where he played Santa to hear kids' desires for Christmas. This eventually led to a very awkward moment when his next customer ended up being his nemesis, Bart, as well as trying to avoid the urge to strangle him due to needing to act in-character. After gift packages were reported to be stolen from porches across Springfield, and Lenny left a clue to the identity of the one responsible, Bart assumed Sideshow Bob was responsible and went to Santa's Village, only to discover that his ""plans"" referred to his life goals. Bob then offered to help Bart catch the one responsible for the thefts, and hid in a package to draw out the culprits, who turned out to be Smithers and Mr. Burns, who did their actions because the latter had a horrible Christmas as a child. Bob then tells him that he became strong during that Christmas.
 Sideshow Bob has appeared in various Simpsons Comics.
 For example in issue 2 story ""Cool Hand Bart"" where Bart, Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, Kearny, and Milhouse attend a seminar, called ""Scared Spitless"", which is held in Springfield State Prison and intended to scare trouble-making kids into shaping up. Chief Wiggum decides that all the kids attending the seminar should spend an hour in an actual prison cell. Bart and Milhouse are put in Bob's cell, and to avoid being killed, Bart climbs through the bars and into a van. The van winds up in a work-camp, where Bart is chained up with Bob. Bob escapes with Bart, and they leap onto a moving train. Until Bob is able to get onto the train himself, he is left bouncing on his end of the chain, repeatedly hitting his head on the ground. Soon, however, he climbs aboard and advances on Bart with murderous intent. Just as Sideshow Bob is about to kill Bart, Bart points out that he would have to drag his corpse around, because they are chained together. Postponing his plan to kill Bart, they walk through the swamp while Bart follows until they reach a hacksaw sale. They go in, but Bob is forced to hide his hair in a hat to keep from being noticed and identified. They realize that Wiggum is at the sale, and Bart sucks his hat off with a vacuum cleaner, revealing him to the police. Finally, Bob is arrested and Bart goes home safe.
 He appears again in issue 11 ""Fallen Flanders"" where he teams up with Kang and Kodos and together they abduct Ned Flanders and replace him with an evil clone. Ned's uncharacteristic behavior convinces Bart and Lisa to investigate alongside actor Rainier Wolfcastle who had previously encountered the aliens' clones, this turns out to have been Sideshow Bob's plan all along and the three are abducted. Eventually, the aliens are defeated and Sideshow Bob escapes on a helicopter he realizes too late is driven by Chief Wiggum.
 He appears in issue 23 story ""Bart de Triomphe"" which introduces his nephew Neil.
 He and his brother Cecil appear in jail together in issue 41, story ""Bart Simpson and the Krusty Brand Fun Factory"". Krusty gives Ralph, Barney, Bart, Nelson, Chief Wiggum, Grampa, Homer (disguised as Barney's mother) and Snake (claiming to be Nelson's parole officer) a tour of his new factory in a boat on a cherry soda river which includes a water slide. Unbeknownst to Krusty and the visitors, Sideshow Bob has hacked into Krusty's computer and he drops a giant cherry on the boat. Krusty escapes while everyone else is forced to take refuge in the frozen food division. Bob releases flying cyborg monkeys that attack the visitors. They try to fight back until Krusty arrives in a jet and saves them. Krusty gets revenge on Bob by knocking his jet into Bob's prison cell.
 In issue 46 story ""Angels with Yellow Faces"" he was paroled from prison. Bob wanted to make more money, so he starts a small business-Sideshow Bob's VCR repair and pet sitting. In the back of the building was his school of crime- where he would teach other people to become criminals. He uses Nelson Muntz, Dolph Starbeam, Kearney Zzyzwicz, and Jimbo Jones to steal money from people all over town. Meanwhile, Bart photocopies his butt and is caught by Chief Wiggum. Wiggum knows about Bob's scheme, but he has no proof, so he tells Bart- ""You won't get in trouble if you infiltrate his gang"". Bart cannot say no and joins the gang. Bob is planning to kill him until Bart aces the test. Bob is very proud and says that he will do his master scheme the next day. Bart tells Chief Wiggum that he doesn't know what it is. The next day, Bob drives to the hospital, planning to kidnap Mr. Burns (who is only there because of his love of children's tender organs). Nelson pushes Mr. Burns into a fake ambulance, where Bob drives away, but the police stand in front of them. Bob believes Bart called them and prepares to kill Bart with a high powered drug. Bart shocks Bob, and the police take him away. Lisa says she called in the cops after following him there. They hug each other.
 In issue 77 story ""The Many Faces of Bob"" He is released from prison but soon ends up in the hospital and gets a new face. After Bart and Lisa discover this they become worried as they do not know what he looks like anymore. They eventually discover this was exaggerated and his new face is basically exactly the same as before. He is knocked out by Sideshow Mel.
 In issue 108 story ""Big House Homer"" Homer is framed by Mr. Burns and Smithers and made Sideshow Bob's cellmate (though Homer fails to recognize Bob at first), due to a common dislike for Bart, Homer and Bob become quick friends. Bob takes Homer on a tour of the prison and Homer points out a masked prisoner who Bob claims to be a nameless psycho. Bob reveals to Homer a plan to escape jail, Bob's secret tunnel is under the cell of the masked prisoner. When Homer and Bob get into the cell the prisoner asks if he can come along. Homer quickly jumps into the tunnel when the prisoner reveals he knows who Homer is. The prisoner chases Homer through the tunnel while telling him that he can't escape the past. Homer falls into a cavern full of crates, the prisoner jumps down and removes his mask revealing, Frank Grimes, Jr. Grimes reminds Homer that he was sent to jail for attempting to murder Homer to avenge the death of his father, Frank Grimes. Mr. Burns and Smithers enter the cavern and reveal it's Burns' secret stash of rare paintings. Sideshow Bob falls through the hole in the ceiling and knock out both himself and Grimes. Homer blackmails Burns to get him out of jail, otherwise he blabs about the paintings, Burns agrees and Homer is set free, while Bob and Grimes are returned to prison.
 In Issue #123 story ""Bobbing for Vengeance"" Bob becomes popular on the television series Big House Live that broadcasts live from the prison where they show Sideshow Bob is in the kitchen and cook a Flaming Vengeance, around the same time everyone seems to start trying to kill Bart. The next day the family is at home and watches Big House Live in which Sideshow Bob explains that he has help from his spiritual advisor and now he wants to make peace with the world and not kill a young boy. A picture of that spiritual advisor is on the screen and Lisa tells Bart that she recognizes him. Lisa and Bart start to looking at copies of the show and Bart and Lisa discover that they almost always see Sideshow Bob's spiritual advisor and he has a pocket watch, and they realize he is a hypnotist. They pause the DVD and find that in some seconds they show the text, Vote for Bob. Be Like Bob.. They realize that Bob is using hypnosis with subliminal messages so anyone who sees the program wants to kill him. Bart becomes really scared and outside the door is the residents of Springfield who want to come to play with Bart, when they see Bart in the house, he escapes and they start chasing him. Bart manages to escape the crowd and he decides to dress up as Sideshow Bob and tell the mob to leave Bart now, but they realize that it's Bart and intend to kill him, but then came the real Sideshow Bob and with his hypnotist and he gets all of Springfield to forget what happened to want to kill Bart himself. Chief Wiggum then appears and tells them that like all reality shows there's a twist, there was never any parole, that was just a way for the city to save some money and get some criminals out of they temporarily overcrowded jail. But because they did not have to pay to feed him they even managed to save a few bucks on the side for the Police Retirement and Buffalo wing. Sideshow Bob realizing he's facing life in prison no matter what he does and Wiggum confirms that. Sideshow Bob then starts to hunt Bart at his home, and Bart asks for help from Homer, but he can't leave the TV, showing live the hunt between Bart and Bob.
 A British version of Sideshow Bob makes a minor cameo in issue 208, 'Brit Simpson', on page 11. His name was Sideshow Bobby.
 He has unusually large feet (they actually fill his over-sized clown shoes). Apparently, if he needs to disguise himself, he can actually fold his feet just to wear ""normal"" shoes. He is tall with slender limbs and a plump paunch. His favorite weapon is a carving knife, which he is regularly depicted holding. In the episode Cape Feare, he uses a machete.
 Sideshow Bob's defining feature is his curly, palm tree-shaped red hair (the palm-tree style has been used as visual gags in various episodes). His hair is exceedingly long when wet (as seen in Cape Feare), pulled or brushed. It tends to recoil and bounce back into shape with great ease. When he first appeared in The Telltale Head, he had an afro-like hairstyle, with a darker shade of red.
 Bob's ""Die Bart, Die"" tattoo Sideshow Bob has various tattoos all over his body, some of which are against Bart.
 Bob's tattoo on his back The tattoos have generally not been shown since, though it has not been confirmed if they have been removed or not.
 Sideshow Bob, in a way, mirrors Hannibal Lecter; a psychopath who could recite Shakespeare by heart while stabbing you in yours.
 Sideshow Bob enjoys the finer things in life, including reading classical literature and playing an instrument (a violin). Likely due to his upbringing, he has a passion for theater, knowing Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore off by heart as well as Shakespeare's works. In contrast to his love of the 'higher pleasures', he despises television and other 'low class' things, which gives him a rather snobbish attitude. Despite his love of higher pleasures, he ironically hates the Ivy League school of Princeton University, which he disparagingly referred to as ""Clown College"" at least once. Ironically, in his time when he was a Master Criminal, he studied the uses of Dynamite, which would theoretically be considered low class. At times, he also may have genuine desires to help humanity, as he explains that his motivation for tricking the Springfield citizens into electing him was to ""save them from themselves"".
 Beneath the cultured gentlemen is the heart of a cold-blooded killer; Bob is a man who thinks nothing of hurting others to get what he wants, even if this includes himself. Bob's primary motive seems to be revenge; his original crime (framing Krusty the Clown) was an attempt to get back at him for making a clumsy fool of Bob for years as his sidekick, and most of his other crimes have been attempts at murdering Bart Simpson for foiling him. However, he has made several attempts at acquiring money and/or power, such as when he tried to kill Selma Bouvier or run a campaign for mayor as a republican (if for no other reason than to make the Simpsons miserable).
 Despite his cold-blooded status, he does at times attempt to change. A notable instance was when he was released by Cecil and fully intended to change his past felon ways (even having reluctance at hurting Bart, his worst enemy). In addition, he also has some reserves, as when choosing to fashion a new life, he immediately rejects North Korea as a location for him to settle in. Similarly, the closest he ever came to killing Bart, he ended up saving him instead due to having second thoughts twice: The first time was when he brainwashed Bart into acting as a suicide bomber against Krusty as revenge (which he abandoned at the last minute after learning Krusty had regrets to his treatment over Bob during his time as his sideshow), and the second time was when preparing to tie Bart and Milhouse to a missile after he tricked the latter into exposing his location.
 Bob with his wife and child Largely because of his former status as a clown, he also was capable of extreme physical feats. For instance, he was able to contort his body to such an extent that he could easily fit into a package (which he implies was due to having to ride in Krusty's clown car cross-country). He also claimed that repeated blows from cream pies left his face immune to pain, short of self-inflicted surgeries as Bob learned the hard way. His face being immune to pain is somewhat implied with the rake gag, as he repeatedly gets hit by a rake in the face, yet only utters a growl of annoyance rather than actually appearing to be in pain. He was also adept at mimicking voices, particularly Krusty's, which he used to great effect when framing him.
 Bob has a brother named Cecil, who is jealous of Bob for stealing his role during his audition for The Krusty the Klown Show, and tried to frame Bob for fraud. His parents are doctor, Robert Terwilliger Sr., and talented actress, Dame Judith Underdunk. After moving to Italy and becoming mayor of a small Italian village, Bob married a woman named Francesca (it is unconfirmed if they may be separated or divorced, as he is seen making plans to date an ""age-appropriate woman"" after ""retirement"" and flirting with Cassandra Patterson in Bobby, It's Cold Outside) and with her, had a son named Gino. When Homer must go to Italy to get Mr. Burns' new sports car, they just happen to stop in Bob's village. Bob tries to hide his past from his new wife but is unable, contrary to Bob's fear, his wife and son try and help him kill Bart.
 Sideshow Bob declared himself an enemy of Krusty, as his role on The Krusty the Clown Show was regularly cruel and demeaning. Since framing Krusty for armed robbery, Bob has attempted to kill him a couple of times. However, the last time Bob tries to, Krusty publicly confesses his regret for abusing him in his show by singing a nice song for him as an apology, which touches Bob so much. With that in line, they seemed to bury the hatchet. Despite this, he was seen holding a sign saying ""Die Clown"" when Krusty was drowning in a frozen lake in an attempt at baptism, and earlier had a sign in ""Walt Warren's"" house that said, ""Kill Krusty, too!"" (which is the only thing besides a reminder to buy milk that wasn't a message saying ""Kill Bart"") implying that Bob still has trace amounts of hatred towards Krusty.
 Sideshow Bob is about to kill Bart. He became Bart's nemesis after Bart figured out he had framed Krusty, getting him sent to prison. Ever since then, Bob has been obsessed with killing Bart, constantly plotting his revenge in prison. The first few times he was released from jail, Sideshow Bob would carry out a plan to murder Bart, or count it as a 'bonus' to one of his other schemes (the only three exceptions being when he successfully became Mayor, as he found it more fitting to just put Bart back in Kindergarten and demolish the Simpson house for the construction of ""Matlock Highway"" than to simply murder Bart , was released under the prison Christianity movement, where he attempted to atone for his sins, and most notably does not desire to even hurt Bart at all, and when Homer had disappeared from the third attempt at a wedding, where he interacted with Bart and Lisa in a manner that belied no hostility, and in fact also gave them a hint from the key-chain that the actual culprits were Selma and Patty Bouvier). Eventually, when he finally had Bart at his mercy, he lets him go, as he has become ""accustomed to his face"". Strangely, Bob does not seem to hold any distinctive grudge against Lisa, despite the fact that she ruined his plans as mayor of Springfield, mayor of a small Italian village (unintentionally), and his attempt on the lives of her entire family (which even included her). This is possibly because they have similar intellectual and cultural levels and, somehow, respect each other. He also does not hold a grudge against Marge, Homer, or even Maggie, since he has no reason to hate them.
 It is often implied that the real reason behind Bob's obsession with killing Bart is ego rather than to siege revenge on him for landing him in prison, as he finds it infuriating that an underachieving 10-year-old is constantly able to foil him with such ease.
 The closest thing Bob has to a catchphrase comes from this relationship: sometimes, Bob will reveal himself saying ""Hello, Bart"" in a menacing tone to which Bart (and sometimes Lisa and the rest of the Simpsons in unison) will exclaim ""AH! Sideshow Bob!"". However, in Gone Boy, Bob forces Milhouse to show them where Bart was located (being the only one who found the manhole Bart fell into). Predictably, he then shoves Milhouse down the manhole and prepares to use the military missile bunker's missiles to do away with his nemesis. However, he ultimately had a change of heart, and he and Bart accepted a truce and became friends. Despite this, Bart was still wary of him, as depicted in Bobby, It's Cold Outside, where he was terrified upon learning that Sideshow Bob is the Santa's Village's main attraction, although Bob made clear that he had absolutely no intention of even harming Bart, let alone killing him (he claims it's because his taking the part of Santa makes him compelled to stay in character as long as possible and thus cannot afford to act on his murderous urges, though his ""life goals"" folder that Bart discovered not even mentioning any harmful intentions towards the boy  implies he genuinely stopped trying to act on his murderous impulses against Bart).
 Due to them being responsible for Bart's existence, having a large role in spoiling his plans and/or causing him physical harm, not to mention ruining his possibilities to be redeemed and thus having finally a normal life, Bob developed an insane obsession also for the rest of the Simpsons and tried to kill them alongside Bart for revenge.
 When Bob follows the Simpsons to their new home after they became a part of the Witness Protection Program, he clambers out from beneath their car, he steps on the end of a rake lying on the ground, causing it to fly up and hit him in the face and he shudders. He turns away from it, only for the same to happen, as another rake is lying nearby. It turns out that there are many rakes in this area, as the event repeats itself for some time. He is repeatedly the target of the rake slapstick gag, causing him to declare rakes as his greatest foe ""besides Bart Simpson"". In The Simpsons Game, when Bob steps on one rake and it flies up and hits him in the face, it knocks him out. When Bob was attempting to murder Bart at Five Corners, (the only place in America where 5 states meet) Bart caused him to hop back and forth from state to state until he jumps on a rake which then hits him in the face. Most recently, Bob accidentally stepped on a rake underwater, after falling from atop Springfield Dam into the water below when he was ""walking"" away at the end of The Man Who Grew Too Much.
 Sideshow Bob and his other nemesis, rakes His occupation was to be Krusty's sidekick on The Krusty the Clown Show. He didn't even want the job: Bob accompanied his brother to the auditions and unwittingly impressed Krusty enough to be hired on the spot. His job before is unknown. He gave up on his sidekick job after he went to prison for framing Krusty, and has since become a master criminal, although the ""master"" part is spurious, as he has been repeatedly foiled by children. However, while being arrested the first time around, he warns the adults to not look down on children as they are more intelligent than they appear as ""they were smart enough to get me!"", implying that Bart and Lisa may have intelligence above most average kids.
 The Notice that shows Sideshow Bob has appeared in The Simpsons: Tapped Out game available on iOS and Android In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", set 30 years after the regular series, it is implied that Bob has been murdered, as his chalk outline can be seen on the floor of Moe's Tavern, among other outlines, including the Capital City Goofball. It also could be implied that he accidentally killed himself from stepping on a rake, as there is also an outline of a rake next to his outline.
 In ""Gone Boy"", a flash-forward scene at the end reveals that, in the future, he lives in a lighthouse. Regretting trying to get revenge since he wasted his life doing it, he tells this to Jeremy Freedman that life is short and not to waste it on revenge.
 Sideshow Bob finally succeeds in killing Bart Sideshow Bob appears as the main antagonist of one segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XXVI"", entitled ""Wanted: Dead Then Alive"". In this story, Bob uses Milhouse's cellphone to text Bart and lure him into the music room alone after school. Once he has Bart cornered, he pulls out a harpoon gun and aims it at the boy. Bart is unfazed by the threat, certain that Bob will bungle his plan as usual. Bob responds by shooting him in the chest and killing him. Having finally succeeded in killing a 10-year-old child after 24 years, Bob sings with joy and changes his FiendBook status from ""Attempted Murderer"" to ""Murderer"".
 Bob takes Bart's corpse home with him and amuses himself for several days desecrating the body. Once he grows bored with the dead boy, he decides to move into his ""post-Bartum"" phase and accepts a job as an associate professor at Springfield University. However, the school's standards are so low that simply reading the sign outside the entrance is the only requirement for acceptance, and Bob finds himself highly dissatisfied with the quality of his students (who spend most of his class looking up the answers to his questions online). Eventually, Bob comes to realize that he was happier when his life revolved around trying to kill Bart, so he decides to bring him back to life.
 Using supplies he looted from the university's Engineering, Chemistry, and Occult departments, Bob constructs a machine that brings Bart back to life. Bob proceeds to repeatedly kill Bart, each time using his machine to bring him back to life so that he may be killed again. Eventually, Lisa sees Bart's dismembered body through Bob's basement window. She comments that she always suspected Bob was responsible for Bart's disappearance, even though Snake Jailbird had already been tried, found guilty, and executed for the crime.
 Lisa returns later with the rest of her family. They break into Bob's basement and use the machine to restore Bart to life. Bob walks in on them and pulls out a rifle to shoot them, but Homer hits him over the head with a lamp. Homer continues to beat Bob with the broken lamp until it decapitates him. Bart then takes Bob's head, along with a pair of deer antlers, frog legs, a wild boar's tail, the headless body of a chicken, and some of his own boogers for good measure, and uses the reanimation machine to bring Bob back to life as a horrible freaky creature. Afterwards, Bob, as Sideshow Chicken, returns to his job as a professor at Springfield University, but his students are too distracted by his appearance to learn anything.
 He tries to kill the Simpson family once again during the opening sequence for Treehouse of Horror XXVII along with one of the Rigellians, the ghost of Frank Grimes and a Leprechaun. However, once again he fails, as Maggie decapitates all four of them, killing everyone but Frank's ghost (the latter only because, due to his obviously being dead already, he couldn't die again).
 In the Simpsons/Family Guy crossover, Stewie Griffin captures and tortures Bart's enemies, one of them being Sideshow Bob.
 Sideshow Bob appears as the main antagonist (although Kelsey Grammer refers to him as the ride's host) in The Simpsons Ride at the Universal Studios parks, in which he once again goes after Bart and the rest of the Simpson family.
 Sideshow Bob also appears as a new mascot along with Krusty as part of an expansion at Universal Studios in Florida and Hollywood.
 Bob appears in Stage 5, The Springfield Butte. He carries a chicken in a food tray for the Simpsons to gain their health.
 Bob was included as the boss of the Krustyland level in the 1991 video game Bart vs. the Space Mutants. He attacks by jumping around at Bart, and can only be defeated by stomping on his feet multiple times. If the player spelled Lisa's name earlier, she'll aid Bart by dropping bowling balls on Sideshow Bob's head, stunning him long enough for the player to land a clean hit on his feet. Oddly, he was primarily blue in this.
 In The Simpsons Road Rage, there is a ""Wanted"" sign of Sideshow Bob in Evergreen Terrace. For some reason, he is named as ""Sideshow"" Bob Roberts. On it, he is wanted for 5,000 dollars.
 Sideshow Bob appears at the end of Invasion of the Yokel-Snatchers to reveal himself as being in league with Kang and Kodos and prepares to do in Bart and Homer when he steps on a rake and knocks himself out.
 Sideshow Bob appears in the game at random and the player has to catch him. If you are not quick, he goes into hiding. Once you find Sideshow Bob, you get fifty-two dollars. You can also get him in the Terwilliger event.
 Sideshow Bob's Afro from ""The Telltale Head"" Sideshow Bob debuted in the Season 1 episode ""The Telltale Head"". In that appearance, his design was simpler and his hair was round in shape. However, towards the end of the episode, he appears again, in a panning shot of a crowd, with his familiar hairstyle. His first major appearance was in season one's penultimate episode ""Krusty Gets Busted"". Bob's design was updated for the episode, and the animators tried to redo his scenes in ""The Telltale Head"" with the re-design, but did not have enough time. He was briefly seen in the mob with his normal hair.
 For Season 3's ""Black Widower"", the writers decided to have Bob return to get revenge on Bart for foiling his plan in ""Krusty Gets Busted"". They took the idea of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner and had Bob always inserting himself into Bart's life. However, he did not appear in every season because the writers were not always able to think of reasons to bring Bob back, especially since Sideshow Bob episodes are written backward so they can work on the plotline. Another reason is that Kelsey Grammer is not a regular voice actor in the show.
 The script for ""Krusty Gets Busted"" called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead went with Cheers and Frasier actor Kelsey Grammer. Bob did not say anything during the first half of the episode, because the character always spoke with a slide whistle, and when he finally did speak, it would be a shock to hear Grammer's sophisticated, dulcet tones. Grammer used his impression of Ellis Rabb, a man that Grammer had once worked for, for Bob's voice.
 Brad Bird first designed Bob for ""Krusty Gets Busted"". As the episode's animation progressed, he made Bob sleeker, more urbane and refined, and worked with Grammer's voice. For ""Black Widower"", David Silverman updated the model to reflect the animation of Bird.
 Despite common fan belief that Bob was named after the character Dr. Terwilliker from the film that Dr. Seuss wrote: The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, he was actually named after Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, Oregon.
 In twenty-one seasons of The Simpsons, Sideshow Bob has been heavily featured in ten episodes. Kelsey Grammer initially thought that Bob would be a one-time character, and calls him ""the most popular character I've ever played."" The writers believe that Grammer has a great voice and try to create something for him to sing in each episode he appears in. Grammer usually comes in for table readings, although when he cannot, Gregg Berger stands in for him. Former Executive producer David Mirkin found Grammer a joy to direct as he was very funny but noted that he hates doing the evil Sideshow Bob laughs. A rule for the early episodes that featured Bob was that there had to be a recap of his evil deeds in case the viewers did not remember them. The concept was dropped in later episodes or at least simplified.
 Sideshow Bob's theme, which is used whenever Bob gets out of prison, was first used in the season three episode ""Black Widower"", Bob's second episode. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, which was composed by Elmer Bernstein. The musical score for ""Cape Feare"" earned composer Alf Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for ""Outstanding Dramatic Underscore - Series"" in 1994. Bob's prisoner number is often 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in Les Misérables. Another trademark for Bob is to step on rakes, a joke that first appeared in ""Cape Feare"". In that episode, Bob stepped on nine consecutive rakes, which the writers added to fill up time. The sequence has become known as the ""rake joke"" and has been referred to as being ""genius in its repetitive stupidity"". His last name, Terwilliger, may have been taken from George J. Terwilliger III, a prominent Republican lawyer who served as United States Deputy Attorney General under George HW Bush.
 Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob for The Simpsons Movie, but the scene in which he was to appear was cut.
 In a 2006 article, IGN.com ranked Bob in the second position on their list of the ""Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters"", citing that he is ""a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree-like hair, doesn't seem to match up to the well-spoken and even musically talented maniac."" Wizard Magazine rated Bob as the 66th greatest villain of all time.
 WatchMojo placed Sideshow Bob as the 10th best Simpsons side character and the #1 Simpson villain, he surpassed Mr. Burns.
 WickedBinge placed Sideshow Bob as the evilest character in The Simpsons, outranking even Mr. Burns, who is considered to be the main antagonist of the series.
 Kelsey Grammer has received praise for his voice work and in 2006, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Bob in the episode ""The Italian Bob"". Grammer had previously won four in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category for his portrayal of Frasier Crane on Frasier. In a 2007 interview, Simpsons executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as his second favorite guest star, saying ""his voice is so rich"". Mike Bruno of Entertainment Weekly called Kelsey Grammer one of ""fourteen guest stars whose standout performances on TV make us wish they'd turn up in a Simpsons Movie 2"". David Hyde Pierce was also included in that list. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star listed ""Cape Feare"", ""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"" and ""Brother from Another Series"" as being among the best episodes of the series, saying ""Forget Frasier, these are Kelsey Grammer's best roles.""
 The production staff on The Simpsons are usually excited about ""Sideshow Bob episodes"" as the writers consider them a treat to write, and the directors think they are always crazy and fun for them to animate.
 Bob action figure Many episodes featuring Bob have been well received by fans and critics. ""Cape Feare"", the third episode to feature Sideshow Bob, is generally regarded as one of the best episodes of The Simpsons, and according to Matt Groening, people often include it among their top 10 favorites. In Entertainment Weekly's top 25 The Simpsons episodes ever, it was placed third. In 2006, IGN.com named Cape Feare the best episode of the fifth season. Vanity Fair called it the show's fourth-best episode in 2007, as ""this episode's masterful integration of film parody and a recurring character puts it near the top."" Associated Content chose the score for this episode to be 11th place of all of The Simpsons episodes. Grammer's performance of H.M.S. Pinafore was later included on the album Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons. The season 17 episode ""The Italian Bob"" and its writer John Frink would win a Writers Guild of America Award in 2007 in the animation category.
 Bob was made into an action figure, and two different versions were included as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first shows Bob as he was on The Krusty the Clown Show, and was released in 2001 as part of the Krustylu Studios wave three playset. The second, released in 2002, has him in the prison uniform he wore in ""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"", and was a part of wave nine. He was also made into a collectable Funko Pop! figure, being part of wave 3 of their Simpsons series.

Jebediah Springfield,True,False,False,False,False,1,Shearer,14,"Hans Sprungfeld, better known as Jebediah Obadiah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield, was the purported historical founder of the town of Springfield and a murderous pirate.
 Statue Hans Sprungfeld was born around the year 1774 to poor farmers in Axhandle, Virginia, where he learned various skills from his parents. Sprungfeld left his home and joined a merchant ship, where he became a pirate.
 Sprungfeld was most famous for attacking George Washington with an ax during an attempt to kill him in 1781 while he was stationed in Trenton, New Jersey. Washington handily fought Hans back, and, bested, Sprungfeld escaped back to sea. To hide his identity, Hans changed his name to Jebediah Springfield in 1796 and formed a town.
 According to folklore, Jebediah Springfield led a band of wagons and headed westward with his partner Shelbyville Manhattan. They later parted over political differences; Manhattan wanted to found a town where people could marry their own cousins, while Springfield wanted a town devoted to chastity, abstinence, and a flavorless mush he called ""root-marm"". Manhattan went on to find the rival town of Shelbyville.
 Despite Springfield's hero status in modern-day Springfield many of his famed deeds have come into question under historical examination. On an expedition to Springfield's historic ""Fort Springfield"", Bart uncovered inconsistencies in the Jebediah Wacking Day legend, pointing out that he was participating at the Battle of Ticonderoga the day he supposed started whacking snakes.
 Lisa later proved that ""Jebediah Springfield"" was in fact a bloodthirsty pirate and enemy of George Washington named Hans Sprungfeld, who had changed his name in 1796 to hide his identity. He wrote his confession on a scrap of paper that formed the ""missing piece"" of the famously incomplete portrait of George Washington, which he procured when he stepped on the original painting while it was still wet. However, upon seeing the town pride Springfield has for their founder and history, Lisa decided to keep the discovery to herself.
 A distinguishing characteristic of Sprungfeld was his prosthetic silver tongue, which was built to replace his real tongue which was bitten off by a Turkish pirate during a grog house fight. According to The Simpsons Guide to Springfield rumors state that the silver tongue is currently in the possession of Mayor Quimby, who uses it as a paperweight.
 Springfield is said to have dramatically killed a bear with his bare hands, though revisionist historians have determined the bear in fact probably killed him. A statue depicting Springfield's victory stands in the center of the Springfield town square, in front of the city hall. His secret will contains a confession that he was suffering from then fatal diphtheria and according to Lisa Simpson's research, he died of this illness. The will also reveals that the untameable buffalo he was believed to have tamed was already tame and that he merely shot it. According to Bart, he may have been shot by Natives after the townspeople traded guns for corn but the Indians shot them and took the corn.
 Springfield had many famous quotations, such as ""A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man"", and was well known for his figurative and literal silver tongue. He also wears a coonskin cap.
 The Springfield Historical Society, headed by Hollis Hurlbut, is devoted to the study of the town's history, specially Jebediah's. Hurlbut, who is aware of Springfield's true background, keeps the truth hidden.
 The Springfield Marathon commemorates an occasion on which he ran across six states in order to avoid his creditors.
 The Springfield's monument also contains the Jebediah's bear.
 The statue was once beheaded with a hacksaw by Bart, who thought that it would make him more popular. In reality, the town became depressed and angry, leaving Bart to endure “The Tell-Tale Heart”-style guilt before he returned the head to its rightful place. It appears that while the head is back in its rightful place it has never been properly re-attached, as it frequently falls off.

Aristotle Amadopolis,True,False,False,False,False,3,stars,15,"Aristotle in the comics Aristotle Amadopolis is the owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant, as well as the rival of Charles Montgomery Burns.
 He was introduced to Homer by Mr. Burns after Homer unwittingly ""saves"" the plant from a total meltdown. Amadopolis wanted Homer to give a pep talk to his plant's lackluster workers about what it means to be a valuable employee. Homer was, however, hesitant to accept, but Burns forces him into it. At the Shelbyville nuclear power plant, Homer gave a bumbling speech when an impending meltdown threatened the Shelbyville plant. They all turned to ""Hero Homer"" and ushered him into the control room, asking him to perform his heroic deeds once more. In front of everyone, Homer repeated his juvenile rhyme that saved him the first time and presses a button blindly and once more by sheer dumb luck, he manages to avert this meltdown as well. Amadopolis thanked Homer for saving the Shelbyville nuclear plant, then his mood swings when he then launches into a tirade chastizing Homer for reciting a childish rhyme during a time of emergency. He quizzed Homer as to what button he just pushed. Homer failed to remember that the formal name was the emergency override button; instead answering ""Moe?"". This had exposed Homer's success as dumb luck, leading to it becoming a source of derision and the slang term ""pulling a Homer"".
 Amadopolis was later seen in ""Homer at the Bat"", where he had lunch with Mr. Burns at the Millionaire's Club. Amadopolis had supreme confidence in his plant's softball team and bet $1 million against the SNPP softball team, which astonished even Burns with such a wager.
 Even though Amadopolis was from Shelbyville, he does not seem to bear the intense hatred that those residents have for Springfield, or he feels the rivalry ought to stay civil. He was seen patronizing Moe's Tavern in one episode.
 As seen in ""The Buck Stops Everywhere,"" Amadopolis is a member of the Fat Cats, a gang dedicated to shunning minimum wage workers. Other members include C. Montgomery Burns and The Monopoly Man. They are seen escaping from a helicopter made of gold to escape from minimum wage workers.

Luann Van Houten,False,False,False,True,False,3,Gaven,16,"Luann Van Houten (née Mussolini) is the wife (and first cousin) of Kirk Van Houten and the mother of Milhouse Van Houten. She has been married to Kirk twice; although divorced due to an argument at one of Homer and Marge's disastrous dinner parties, she later got remarried to Kirk. However, the marriage is almost unchanged when they were married before.
 Luann is apparently of Italian and Greek descent. Her mother, Sophie, is Italian, although Luann never speaks Italian or is seen with her mother (who remains in Italy with Luann's half-brother, Bastardo). Luann was born in Shelbyville, a town founded on the principle of freedom to marry one's cousins. Her birthday is December 1. She lacks the stereotypical exaggerated mannerisms associated with most other Italian-Americans in Springfield, such as Fat Tony or the chef Luigi Risotto. When younger, she went to ""Camp Land-A-Man"" (which basically served as a finishing school) with Marge, Patty and Selma, the future Helen Lovejoy (maiden name unknown), and future realtor Cookie Kwan.
 Luann was married to her cousin Kirk Van Houten and gave birth to Milhouse. Their marriage came to an unhappy end; after an argument over a game of Pictionary, she leaves Kirk. Although Kirk found single life tough, Luann used her newfound freedom and heretofore stifled promiscuity to live life in the fast lane. Luann began dating American Gladiator Pyro shortly after her divorce, but was caught cheating on Pyro with his (former) best friend, Gyro. It is implied that Luann had a one-night stand with Otto in the episode Moe Letter Blues after Otto tells Kirk ""even I hooked up with your old lady"" before apologizing to Milhouse, who says that Otto is his ""favorite uncle"". Even while married to Kirk she attended a key party at which she slept with Dr. Hibbert. Luann also dated Apu, Disco Stu, and Captain McCallister.
 When the Van Houtens are on the verge of reuniting, Bart and Milhouse hatch a scheme to get them to separate again (because Milhouse enjoyed their fighting over him and trying to buy his love). The scheme backfires and nearly results in the separation of Homer and Marge. Since then, they are often seen together. After some years, they plan to marry again. Their honeymoon goes terrible when they are lost at sea and stranded on an island, believed to be dead. When they are rescued, they go back to Springfield, fully reconciled.
 Even though they ultimately got back together, they are shown to still have some marital issues. For example, in Bobby, It's Cold Outside, Milhouse admits when reluctantly refusing to jot down Bart's last words that Luann deliberately locked Kirk out of the house and threatened to take away Milhouse's presents if he so much as even tries to let Kirk inside.
 Milhouse and his parents all look so much alike that Bart once asked if Luann and Kirk were siblings. In the season 26 episode ""Let's Go Fly a Coot"", Milhouse reveals that his parents are actually cousins.
 Luann has bob-cut blue hair and red round glasses. She wears many different outfits. She sometimes wears white pearl earrings. She also had thick blue eyebrows that, according to Kirk, were fake.
 Luann is voiced by Maggie Roswell, but she temporarily became a non-speaking character from seasons 11-14 when Roswell was forced to leave the show after a pay increase dispute. She made her first speaking appearance again in the Season 15 episode ""Milhouse Doesn't Live Here Anymore"".

State Comptroller Atkins,True,False,False,False,False,10,Azaria,17,"State Comptroller Atkins is the school comptroller for Springfield's State. His reputation for educational disbursement is apparently legendary.
 Atkins was sent to deliver the basic assistance grant Springfield Elementary earned after Lisa cheating on a test brought the school's GPA up to the state's minimum requirement. In fact, he was initially impersonated by Otto, who wore a latex mask. Atkins also moderated the elementary school band competition at the state fair. Atkins planned to give Lisa the unusually large good sportsmanship award until he heard her call the first-placed band ""cheaters"" for using glowsticks in their performance, at which point he said, ""Now I'm just going to be sick."" In the episode ""We're On The Road To D'oh-where"" Atkins joins Superintendent Charmers and Principal Skinner over Skype when Bart misbehaves and they discuss how to issue consequences. Atkins might or might not be a Canadian citizen, as when he claimed to be he was actually Otto in disguise. He was also seen rioting after getting trapped in the dome during Trappuccino.
 Promoting Superintendent Chalmer to Super-Duper-Intendent after Cheif Wiggum shoots him in the leg Comptroller Atkins is named after assistant to the producers Jacqueline Atkins.

Mary Bailey,False,False,False,False,False,2,Roswell,18,"Mary Bailey ran for re-election against Mr. Burns and won in a landslide after Marge served Mr. Burns a three eyed fish, which he promptly spat out.
 In season 13's ""The Frying Game"", the governor is briefly mentioned as being a man, implying she is not the governor anymore. In the next season's ""The Seven-Beer Snitch"" she is shown being the governor again.
 Bailey also judged Bart and Lisa's class projects (designing a nsw State flag) in Capital City. She yells in disgust after unfurling Lisa's flag, which Bart had redesigned to make it look like a butt with ""Learn to Fart"" underneath. However, she stated that her reaction was because she felt that she had unfurled the flag poorly.
 Bailey also brings order amongst the prisoners in a jail riot and pardons them. She was also present at the 38th Annual Springfield Media Awards.
 
When Homer got Barney Gumble to get his check, her signature appears on the check. Mary Bailey is an elderly woman with short gray hair. She bears a striking resemblance to Beatrice Simmons.
 Given Mr. Burns' affiliation with the Republican Party, Bailey is presumably a Democrat, although that has never been stated and she could also be an independent politician. She was mayor of Springfield before both Joe Quimby and Hans Moleman. Governor Bailey ordered an investigation about possible pollution by the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The investigation did not find anything on pollution, but did find that the plant was not up to code.

In the Season 3 episode Radio Bart, he was the reporter who first heard ""Timmy O'Toole"" in the well.
 Kent Brockman seems to hold him in slight contempt, possibly because they work in different news mediums. When Shutton arrived at a scene and asked what was going on, Brockman replied, ""Oh, do your research, Shutton!""
 In his most recent, eminent role, Dave comes across Santa's Little Helper in the Simpsons' backyard. He finds the dog balancing a beer can on his nose and Dave, finding this action to be noteworthy, takes a pic of him, saying ""A shot like this only comes once in a lifetime."" The last four words he repeats after the can begins to fall of dog's nose and the photojournalist places the can back on it. The shot is subsequently featured on the front page of the Springfield Shopper, which would grab the attention of Duff Beer.
 Dave is also seen among the media hounds who ask questions about King Homer and take his pictures, which enrages the giant gorilla. When King Homer breaks free from his restraints and gets loose in the theatre, all the journalists and photographers flee for their lives, except for Dave, who screams in terror before being squashed dead when King Homer steps on him.

Birch Barlow,True,False,False,False,False,6,Shearer,20,"Birchibald ""Birch"" T. Barlow is a right-wing conservative talk show host on the radio station KBBL. He also has a show on Fox News.
 On air (and presumably personally), he is a radical conservative, highlighted by his book, ""Only Turkeys Have Left Wings"". His on air rantings are intentionally engineered to be controversial and to rile up the audience, in order to convince them to call, as do many talk back radio hosts. On his radio show, he declares himself to be ""the fourth branch of government"" and ""the fifty-first state"".
 Barlow was instrumental in getting Sideshow Bob released, due to sympathy to Bob as well as believing his story about being framed. He was also ""accused"" by Lisa Simpson of being the true mastermind behind Bob with the implication of Bob simply being a puppet in order to trick Bob into confessing to some of his crimes in court.
 Birch Barlow is a parody of the stereotypical right-wing political commentator. Barlow's voice and appearance is modeled after the late commentator Rush Limbaugh. His name is a possible reference to the John Birch Society, a notorious right-wing advocacy group.
 He has also been a customer at Marge's prescription drug-laden ""yard sale"", a reference to Limbaugh's Oxycontin addiction scandal .
 Birch in the movie In The Simpsons Guide to Springfield, despite his ultra-conservative views, he was shown having dinner at the Shaboom-Kaboom Cafe with Waylon Smithers, John, and Buddy Hodges.

Jasper Beardly,True,False,False,True,False,1,Shearer,21,"Jasper Theodore Beardsley is a resident of the Springfield Retirement Castle and is often seen around Springfield. He is Abe Simpson's friend.
 Jasper with a lollipop Jasper is a World War II veteran. Jasper also tried to avoid the draft by disguising himself as a woman and staying in Springfield to play in the local women's baseball league, along with his friend Abe, who was also avoiding the war. He has been a substitute teacher who confiscated everything made of tin (according to Lisa) and got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener. He also preceded Reverend Lovejoy as minister at the Simpsons' church in Springfield. Jasper's father was a legal immigrant from Ireland and his mother was an illegal Mexican immigrant, who was deported when Jasper was 11.
 Jasper unsuccessfully auditioned for The Be Sharps by singing ""Theme From A Summer Place"".
 It is implied that Jasper is slowly going blind due to his cataracts. This ailment was once cured by a laser fired by a house's security protection equipment, but he was blinded again almost immediately. He accepted this very quickly: ""Oh, well. Easy come, easy go."" Despite the sight problem, Jasper is a light sleeper, and is still quick with his reflexes. When Abe Simpson tried to steal his dentures one night, Jasper turned on the light immediately and, with a gun aimed at Abe, foiled the nocturnal theft. Also, when everyone comes to watch the Itchy &amp; Scratchy (and Poochie) episode ""The Beagle Has Landed"", he looks down to Bart and asks ""Hey, little girl, is this seat taken?"", Bart replies angrily with ""I'm not a little girl!! Are you blind?!"", in which Jasper replies sadly with ""Yes.""
 In ""I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"", he has also stated that he is a diabetic.
 Jasper was put in crude ""suspended animation"" in the Kwik-E-Mart's freezer, and under advice from Dr. Nick Riviera, Apu kept him frozen. When Jasper's frozen body became popular with customers, Apu started exploiting the spectacle, and transformed the Kwik-E-Mart into a special interest store dealing with weird items, or perfectly ordinary ones which had been made out to be abnormal (for example, a cash machine that dispenses pictures of ""dead presidents""). He put a Viking helmet on Jasper (or ""Frostillicus,"" as Apu renamed him), but eventually, Jasper was accidentally unfrozen and stepped out into what he thought was the future. Apu was considering on selling him to The Rich Texan but his dreams of wealth were crushed once again.
 In a montage from ""The Old Man and the ""C"" Student"", Jasper is shown to have a wooden left leg while sparring with Old Jewish Man. Jasper was shot in his artificial leg by Waylon Smithers, on the same night of the nearly fatal shooting of Mr. Burns. However, in several earlier episodes, he was clearly shown to have both feet.
 His beard got caught in a bicycle chain in ""Homer's Triple Bypass"" and a pencil sharpener in ""The PTA Disbands"". He also claimed to have ""broke"" his beard during a Death Race accident with Abe Simpson and Old Jewish Man.
 In ""Singin' in the Lane"", he dies before a bowling match, however, Abe revives him with defibrillator paddles.
 In ""The Springfield Files"", Jasper, under the mistaken belief that it was Wednesday, took some of his Wednesday pills until he learned it was actually Friday, which caused him to morph into a bizarre Lorax-like creature.
 In ""Moe'N'a Lisa"", he is accidentally torched while lighting the Olympic flame.
 In ""I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"", he gets shot in the arm during a bank robbery.
 In ""The Scorpion's Tale"", the extract of Silvertongue causes his eyes to pop out of his sockets.
 In ""The Winter of His Content"", he dies of a heart attack but is revived by Homer who uses a defibrillator on him.
 In ""The Old Blue Mayor She Ain't What She Used to Be"", he hides in a trashcan that bursts into flames.
 Jasper is similar to Hans Moleman since he suffers many accidents.
 Jasper is a friend of fellow resident Abe Simpson, but not always. When Abe's girlfriend Bea died, Jasper told him what had happened and comforted him. However, Jasper possibly bullies Abe regularly - on one occasion, he steals Abe's newspaper because he wants to do the crossword puzzle. He had a wife, Estelle, who is now deceased. He apparently had her cremated, and had his successor, Reverend Lovejoy, proceed with the cremation ceremony, although it later became apparent that the ceremony was invalid as it took place during the three months that Lovejoy's ministering license expired.

First episode appearance
""Homer Goes to College""


Portrayed by
Dan Castellaneta


 Benjamin is one of three nerds that Homer met at Springfield University. He is thin with red hair and a big nose.
 Homer got Benjamin and his roommates Doug and Gary to play a prank on Springfield A&amp;M, a rival school. They kidnapped A&amp;M's mascot, a pig named Sir Oinks-A-Lot, and brought him back to Springfield University. Homer then got the pig drunk by splitting a case of malt liquor with him, and the pig passed out. Dean Peterson heard the noise from the pig falling over and caught the nerds red-handed with the drunken pig. Due to the influence of Sir Oinks-A-Lot's powerful friends, Peterson was forced to expel the three nerds. Homer, however, got off scot-free because the dean didn't actually catch him with the pig.
 Out of guilt, Homer invited the nerds to stay in the Simpson home, where they quickly got on the whole family's nerves. Homer ended up confessing everything to the dean and the nerds were re-admitted to school, much to the Simpsons' relief. Benjamin and his roommates later helped Homer to ""Cram like you've never crammed before!"" for his Nuclear Physics 101 final. When Homer failed the exam, they changed his grade (albeit reluctantly due to ethical concerns) to an A by hacking into the college's database. Marge then made Homer retake the class, so he could set a good example for the kids by passing the class honestly. While Homer re-took the class, Homer shoved the trio of nerds (along with several other students) into a phone booth, and they later played football while in a Tank.

Blinky,True,False,False,False,False,1,,24,"
Blinky the Three-Eyed Fish (or simply Blinky) is a three-eyed orange fish species, found in the ponds and lakes outside the nuclear power plant. The Springfield Nuclear Power Plant caused the mutations.
 The Blinky species is seen quite often in natural bodies of water in Springfield, and is a product of the nuclear waste of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Blinky is caught by Bart at the Old Fishin' Hole and a picture of it is snapped by Dave Shutton and put in The Springfield Shopper. At the same time Mr. Burns was running for governor, and Blinky became a major topic in his election. He defended Blinky saying he was the next step in the evolutionary ladder and not a horrible mutant. As a publicity stunt Mr. Burns has dinner at The Simpsons home, and Marge unexpectedly serves the Blinky that Bart had caught earlier. He ends up spitting it out because he was disgusted by it, which caused him to lose the election to Mary Bailey. Multiple three eyed fish were blinded by drinking the water in their river after Homer and several rednecks (including Cletus Spuckler) dumped Moonshine into the river to avoid being arrested by the police.
 Blinky is the Springfield Curling team's mascot.
 Blinky has met his unfortunate demise by the waste of Michael de Graff Express.
 The Simpsons Arcade Game: Blinky also appears in The Simpsons Arcade Game and can be picked up and thrown at an enemy.
 Bart vs. the World: Blinky appears as an enemy in the Glacier level. He follows the ice flow Bart is riding on, and after a few seconds jumps out of the water to try and hit him. He also appears as one of the characters on the cards in the Concentration mini-game. Blinky is pink rather than orange-yellow, possibly due to graphical limitations.
 The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run: Blinky appears in Level 3, Mission 8. Lisa is tasked to collect several 3-Eyed Fish for the Sea Captain (although she decides to secretly free them all instead).
 The Simpsons: Tapped Out: Blinky appears in the water when you place lakes.
 LEGO Dimensions: While Blinky does not physically appear, Aquaman will mention encountering a three-eyed fish if he and Homer are together.

Otto Mann,True,False,False,False,False,1,Shearer,25,"Otto Sylvester Mann (born January 18) is a former school underachiever who now drives the school bus for Springfield Elementary. Otto was initially conceived by Shearer himself as a caricature of heavy metal music aficionados who mostly play guitar and use drugs while occupying a low-level labor job. He then became a character well known for his party tendencies and calling others slang such as ""dude"", ""lady"", or ""pops"". He is friends with Bart on some occasions, despite their age difference, and dreams of starting his own rock band to become a celebrity, all while getting the school bus into trouble one time after another.
 Otto is notable for being the cool, pot-smoking bus driver, maniacal driving, love of heavy metal music, and propensity for the 1980's junkie lifestyle. According to his driver's license he was 29, as of ""The Otto Show."" He is also confirmed to be 5 ft 10 inch (5'10), on the back flap of the Season 15 box set, showing said license to hold the guide.
 Otto has apparently graduated from Brown University, as shown in ""Lisa Gets an ""A"""". However, due to this information being revealed in a dream, it might be non-canon.
 He was placed under suspension at least twice: Once after he not      only crashed a school bus full of kids for the fifteenth time but was also revealed not to possess a driver's license and another time when he spanked Bart out of fury after Bart stole the bus (and thus cost him his one and only chance of proving himself to Metallica by giving them a ride).
 He has been seen at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings: ""My name is Otto, and I love to get blotto!"" Otto has been seen smoking marijuana  and during Trappuccino, he used a bong. He once had a hallucination in which his shoes were talking to him as a result of his drug use. Skinner stated that also, at one point, he was apparently driving the bus while on narcotics, wondering if Metallica was indeed the real Metallica with their tour bus broken down, until a narcotic-induced hallucination of a dragon confirmed he wasn't seeing things in regards to Metallica. Otto once submitted a urine sample as part of an application for a job as a prison guard, which contained ""crack, smack, uppers, downers, outers, inners, horse tranquilizers, cow paralyzers, blue bombers, green goofers, yellow submarines"" and ""LSD Mach 3"". He only managed to pass because he swapped his sample with Homer's. When Homer violently hallucinates when under the influence of the Guatemalan Insanity Peppers, he advises Ralph Wiggum to quietly disregard and leave Homer alone, showing that he has experience of knowing what to do during drug induced psychosis on others than himself. During the Simpson Movie, Otto barely noticed the Dome causing the town's self-destructive spiral, as he spent most of his time high while bent over a bong.
 Busman, a superhero created by Otto. Otto has a passion for rock music, being very skillful at playing the guitar (saying that it was the only thing he did in high school). Otto's favorite songs include ""Iron Man"" by Black Sabbath, ""Dazed and Confused"" by Led Zeppelin, ""Frankenstein"" by The Edgar Winter Group, ""Freebird"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" by Poison, ""Purple Haze"" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience and ""We're an American Band"" by Grand Funk Railroad. He claims that music is about far off lands (Immigrant Song), deals with the devil (The Devil Went Down to Georgia) and smoke in relation to water (Smoke on the Water).
He also likes Metallica, which is referenced several times, but he doesn't state particular songs. He once actually met the band after driving past their broken tour bus. Otto apparently saved Kirk Hammett from quitting the band after seeing his lighter in a concert at Springfield Arena in 1997. When he tried to offer Metallica a ride, Bart drove off with the school bus. He also once mistook a line at the Post Office set up for tax day for a Metallica concert, and didn't realize his mistake until after Kent Brockman asked him why he waited until the last minute to file his tax returns.
 At a mock-medieval fair at the school, Otto played a song with a strong metaphor towards oral sex (""Dragon in my dungeon, maiden in my lair, there's potion in my wizard's pot, now drink it if you dare), then performed a lute solo in the style of Jimi Hendrix's guitar solos. He put the lute behind his head to play it, smashed it, and then lit the remains on fire on the floor (just as Hendrix did on June 18, 1967 at the Monterey Pop Festival), receiving a round of applause.
 Otto was engaged to be married and plays ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" by Poison while proposing to Becky, but when forced to choose between his fiancée and his music, he prefers his music, dumping her. When he crashed the school bus into the ocean and came close to drowning, he shouted ""Zeppelin rules!"" (referencing Led Zeppelin) as potential last words.
 Rock on! Otto seems to be a comic book fan and even artistic such as creating his own superhero named Busman, a man who drives a school bus by day and fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone by night. He went to a comic book convention to present the idea to Jack Tate, and it is unknown what came of the event.
 He is often found homeless, having been evicted from his apartment and once forced to live with the Simpsons. He was once found squatting in the Simpsons' recently vacated home after the family moved to Cypress Creek.
 It is implied that Otto had sex with Agnes Skinner, because of leaving an overturned jester head from the aftermath of the Mardi Gras party and raising one of the straps to her dress up.
 Otto has multiple tattoos. On his chest he has a giant tattoo of a skeleton with eyes popping out that is driving a race car. He also has a tattoo on his left arm of a burning skull impaled by a knife; he got this tattoo when he was so drunk and/or high that he had no memory of getting it.
 The School Bus Otto's competence in driving any kind of vehicle, let alone a school bus, is highly questionable, however he is the character most frequently depicted as driving any bus or coach in an episode. Otto does not seem to have any respect for the rules of the road, although on one occasion, he told Bart that state law disallowed him from intentionally crashing the bus. Similarly, he seems to at least subconsciously desire to be a safe bus driver, as he once dreamed that he won an award for the district's safest bus driver and was proud enough at the achievement after years of viewing himself as a screw-up to declare in his acceptance speech that it was ""like a dream come true."" Ironically, he actually dreamed this while asleep at the wheel, which resulted in him driving the bus into an auto-wrecking yard in order to avoid running over Jasper at the last possible minute when told to wake up by Milhouse. It's also implied that the School keeps him on retainer despite his questionable competence in driving the school bus because he was the only one they could afford to use as a bus driver, as after Otto ended up suspended with pay for inflicting corporal punishment on Bart for ruining a chance meeting with Metallica, Marge Simpson was forced to act as a carpool for the various children in the neighborhood due to the bus being rendered unavailable as a result. He also was once involved in a reckless street race with the bus, though surprisingly this instance did not result in any crashes or injuries.
 Otto's reckless driving He once told Principal Skinner that he has crashed the school bus fifteen times without a single fatality (although whether he had indeed achieved it without fatalities is questionable, as it was implied that he killed Spinal Tap when he demolished their tour bus when he was rushing to school). He was dismissed from his job when the authorities discovered that he did not hold any kind of license, or any kind of identification at all (he stated that his identification was the fact that he wrote his name on his underwear, only to discover that he was wearing a different pair). He only attained his driving license thereafter because Patty passed him, and this was despite him completely failing to drive the bus in a restrained and secure manner (she passed him because they shared a mutual hatred of Homer, although Otto's license had a ""PROBATIONARY"" stamp on it). Otto has also been shown smoking or being under the influence of marijuana while driving the bus, and has been known to frequently drive drunk. In fact, he expressed surprise and disappointment when he learned that alcohol does not improve one's driving abilities.
 The bus flooding At one time, Otto crashed the bus full of children into the ocean (in this particular instance, it isn't his fault; he has grapefruit citric acid in his eyes that was caused by Milhouse rolling a grapefruit down the passenger aisle and it being caught between the brakes), leaving his passengers to be washed up on an exotic island. Otto himself was seemingly rescued by a Chinese fishing trawler, unaware that its crew was actually planning to enslave him below decks. He accidentally drove his bus into an auto wrecking yard once, crushing it into a scale model of the bus. Once, Otto got the bus stuck onto a railroad track, and while he was jamming to rock music, the bus was struck by an oncoming train.
 Otto is sometimes late to work due to his style of life. At least once, he arrived late due to having partied heavily the night before.
 Otto's father is an Admiral in the United States Navy, and the two do not get along (Jim Morrison's father was also a naval admiral, also having an estranged relationship). His father warned Otto that if he spent all day playing his guitar, his life would amount to nothing, although Otto doesn't really consider his words to have come true, despite everything. He was once engaged to a girl named Becky, but at the wedding she revealed she couldn't stand heavy metal after he hired a Poison cover band to play at the ceremony. Marge then told him he had to choose between Becky and his music - he chose the latter, leaving Becky at the altar. In other episodes Otto has made reference to a girlfriend named Crystal, though this could be a joke about crystal meth.
 Otto in Lisa's Wedding At one of his lowest points in his life, Otto became even more inebriated and drug ridden as an overweight terminal junkie. He managed to have a job as a limousine driver, although the night he drove a senior Bart Simpson and Jenda from Springfield High's prom of 201X (2013 was the episode's set year as by logic of the Floating Timeline), he was barely coherent and was bare naked during the job, and when driving them to Springfield Gorge, immediately stopped in a drug induced stupor and wandered off into the wilderness, where he jumped off a cliff believing he could fly.
 At age 44, he apparently retired from being a Bus Driver and founded a Taxi service business in Springfield. Otto himself appeared on a video screen in ""Muhammad Jafar's"" cab when he was driving Lisa Simpson and Hugh Parkfield to 742 Evergreen Terrace to tell him, while addressing him by his real name that after doing the fare, he should ""get his indicted ass to the convention center pronto!"" In ""24 Minutes"", Otto drives the school bus onto the railroad tracks, either seriously injuring or killing him. In ""Barthood"", he was seen driving a Blood Zoni.
 Otto first appears in the level Around the World in 80 Bites as a contestant in the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge. He later appears in the form of a ghostly skeleton that attacks Homer, Marge, and their army of Hobbit-like children in NeverQuest.
 Otto's look is based on Former Simpsons writer Wallace Wolodarsky. In the commentary for ""Bart the Daredevil"", it is revealed that the writers planned to name him Otto Mechanic, but the joke never appeared in an episode. His name is a joke on the Ottoman Empire, as well as Bart's tendency to greet him with ""Otto, man!"" In ""The Otto Show"" we see his surname on his bus licence, and Principal Skinner sings at the end, ""Hail to the bus driver; bus driver Mann."" In ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge,"" when Otto puts on a top hat to propose to his girlfriend, Becky, he looks similar to Velvet Revolver and former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash.

Terri is younger than Sherri by two seconds. They are in the same class as Bart, by Edna Krabbapel. They are a little bit strange and sometimes they speak in their own language. They will also not hesitate to berate Bart as seen in various episodes. No one knows whether one twin is Terri or Sherri. However, it has been hinted that they may actually be triplets and the third one is out for revenge, but this has yet to be confirmed on the show, and should be considered non-canon at present. Sherri and Terri have long, purple hair and always wear the same clothes.
 Originally in Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire the twins had yellow skin and brown hair instead of the pale skin and purple hair that they have now. 
 Sherri and Terri are completely identical; their normal outfit consists of purple bows wrapped around their waist-length purple hair (colored a darker shade for distinction), purple sweaters, purple skirts, and purple sandals with white socks. They have snout-like noses, and instead of yellow skin like most Caucasian background characters in The Simpsons, their skin is pale.

Clancy Wiggum,True,False,False,True,False,1,Azaria,27,"Chief Clancy Wiggum is the head of the Springfield Police Department. He is an extreme stereotype of a lazy police officer. Chief Wiggum is obese, ignorant and lazy, with a fondness for donuts and guns. While he pretentiously feigns authority, he has little regard for individual rights or even public safety. He is uninformed and continuously flaunts his power, albeit with good intentions most of the time. He is part Irish. He is a major character in The Simpsons and has a supporting role in The Simpsons Movie.
 He, along with most of Springfield's government and its police force, is also corrupt, having asked for or taken bribes several times. When Bart bribed him with stolen wedding presents, he told him to read his badge and, at the bottom of the badge, was the caption ""Cash Bribes Only"". He has a strained friendship with Mayor Quimby. This strained relationship may help to explain why Wiggum has retained his job, despite his inability to do his duties.
 He is often assisted by his more intelligent ""top cops"", Eddie and Lou. He is completely ignorant of Springfield's laws and even makes up his own laws on the fly. According to The Bart Book, Clancy is also in the SPD Bomb Squad, which is in fact just him in a hockey mask.
 Clancy Wiggum was born on April 28, 1947 and was possibly born in Ireland. He seemed to have spent some part of his early childhood in Maryland, as he mentioned that he used to sell ribbons there with his father, Iggy Wiggum. Iggy was a WWII veteran who died in a parade float accident in 1979, along with Arnie Gumble, Sheldon Skinner, Etch Westgrin, and Griff McDonald, who were all members of Abe Simpson's Flying Hellfish. He did, however, grow up in Springfield and was among the same class and age group as Homer Simpson, Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Barney Gumble, and possibly Marge Simpson.
 
At an early age, Wiggum played cops and robbers with Homer and other kids his age, showing a clear ambition to become a police officer.  As student security monitor at Springfield University, at the age of 16. At the age of 16, he was a hall monitor at high school, and possibly had a part-time security guard job at Springfield State University. Wiggum was present at the University's germ research labs (of which Prof. C. Montgomery Burns was chairman at the time) when Mona Simpson and the hippie activist group she was part of sabotaged the germ experiments. Wiggum, who had suffered from asthma prior to that, was cured by antibiotics that the group released to kill the germs, and helped Mona Simpson escape the police when she was on the run twenty-five years later to return the favor. Near the beginning of the school year, Wiggum, then a drug officer, was investigating Lenny, Carl, and Homer for taking marijuana, and had his sniffer dog, Sergeant Scraps, and was successful in the case. Wiggum in the late 1970s. In 1985, Chief Wiggum was involved in the barbershop quartet called the ""Be Sharps"". Wiggum was a member with Homer Simpson, Seymour Skinner, and Apu. However, a talent scout, who showed interest in the Be Sharps, didn't like Wiggum as a performer, saying the idea of a cop in the group was ""too Village People."" Consequently, he was thrown out of the group. When auditions were held to find a replacement for Wiggum, he attempted to be re-selected for the quartet, wearing a disguise similar to Dr. Doolittle, but was found out and rejected from the audition.
 Early attempts to get into the Police Force when he was a teenager were unsuccessful on account of his asthma, so when it had been cured he could then pursue his ambition to become a professional police officer. Having entered the Police Academy by age 24, Wiggum managed to work around his many shortcomings and finally become a full fledged officer. By the age of 34, he had managed to work his way up to the position of Police Chief of Springfield, which most likely was made possible when he ""made a deal with the devil to be chief"". He eventually was promoted to Commissioner after Bart's hoax kidnapping case. It is implied that Wiggum managed to overcome his shortcomings with coaxing methods such as great skills with back massages and charm to get the position of Chief, but he actually received the position when the frustrated former Chief resolved to give it to the next person he met, which was Wiggum. Another explanation is when Mayor Quimby said that he made Wiggum the police chief so that the law would not be enforced to the letter, and he could get away with all his corrupt activities. This may also explain why Chief Wiggum has somewhat of a feud with Mayor Quimby, such as getting into a serious argument with him in regards to Marge's arrest, blackmailing him with incriminating photos, and even trying to arrest Quimby for corruption charges. Regardless, Wiggum had accomplished his childhood dream.
 Wiggum is currently aged somewhere between 38-43 years old. 
 
Wiggum weighs 360 pounds (163.3 kg) and is 5'9"" (175 ¼ cm) tall. Wiggum and his family. Other than his job as Police Chief, he is also the coach for the Mighty Pigs Hockey team. He is also a participant in the Annual Chili Cook-Off, where it is implied that he holds a grudge against Homer Simpson due to his scathing reviews of various chili. One year, he briefly got his revenge on Homer by including in his chili Guatemalan Insanity Peppers, which he added to his chili specifically in anticipation of Homer tasting his. However, Homer eventually got his revenge by tasting multiple tastes of chili while having coated his mouth with wax after drinking hot wax from a candle, leaving Wiggum stunned. However, Wiggum ultimately got the last laugh as the Insanity Peppers ended up causing Homer to undergo a psychotic break.
 Wiggum is also worryingly dismissive of basic firearm safety and uses his gun for various tasks that continuously put his life in danger. Examples include selling pieces of it to feed his family after being fired from his position as chief of police, using it as a nutcracker, and eating donuts off its barrel. When it goes off and nearly shoots him through the head (instead going through the peak of his cap), he merely remarks on what a close call it was and resumes eating.
 It was shown that Wiggum dies at the age of 62 after choking on a sub sandwich he stole from Homer Simpson, who had just been killed by his police department.
 Wiggum capitalizes the negative aspects of the police force and service, especially within Springfield and perhaps the judicial system in general. His badge actually states in fine print, ""cash bribes only"". In addition to the stereotype Wiggum embodies, he often eats donuts, much like Homer Simpson.  
 
Multiple times, Wiggum displays an ignorance for the law, usually making up his own arbitrary reasons for arresting people rather than an actual crime, although sometimes Wiggum has had a clear view of the law, at ties butting heads with Mayor Quimby, who is willing to break legal laws just to retain his position as mayor of Springfield. In some cases, he tries to avoid stopping crimes, such as claiming the caller has the wrong number (912 rather than 911, even though in Homer the Great the “real” number is said to be 912), or is in disbelief when someone is reporting a crime. He also at times mixes up police acronyms, which at times had near disastrous consequences. A notable example of this was his mixing up the terms DOA (Dead on Arrival) and DWI (Driving While Impaired/Driving While Intoxicated), initially claiming to Marge Simpson that her husband Homer had been the former and then corrected himself by stating he was actually the latter when she stated he was dead in horror, only to encounter Mrs. Phillips, whom he earlier called in to pick up her husband due to him supposedly being arrested on a DWI charge, only for him to quickly duck out under the excuse of going to lunch while directing her to another officer due to her husband actually being DOA. Wiggum's badge Wiggum eating donuts with his police gun Despite this, there have been instances where Wiggum proves to be a good cop at times, showing a surprising level of competence when push turns to shove; and it is perhaps this quality which demonstrates why he was appointed as 'chief' in the first place. For example, he successfully located the missing Maggie Simpson and helped Homer chase Marge and Ruth Connors when they became convicts. He showed an unprecedentedly high level of dedication to his police work by conducting an extremely thorough investigation when trying to find the shooter who gunned down Mr. Burns. His dedication to his police work can also be shown when he is encouraged by others, such as in 'Pranksta Rap' and in 'The Fat Blue Line'.
 It is also shown on various occasions throughout the series that he can be quite loving, such as in S17 E07 ""The Last of the Red Hat Mamas"" where he hugs Lou, as well as Homer and Marge in S21 E14 ""Postcards From the Wedge"" . He is also sensitive, fun-loving, and has a cheeky or mischievous sense of humor, and shows genuine care for his son, Ralph. In ""Chief of Hearts"", he is seen to have a close friendship with Homer, due to their similarities. 
 Aside from his late father, Clancy is the husband of Sarah Wiggum (whom he met when arresting her for possession of drugs that he planted on her to ""make her notice him"") and the father of Ralph Wiggum, a second grader at Springfield Elementary. He has an unseen cousin named Mark who went to Pennsylvania State University; Wiggum describes him as a ""fat kid who played a lot of Tetris."" Wiggum also has an unnamed brother who, after attending military school, presumably went crazy and now ""owns and operates a famous cave"", and he claims to have a sister, who is completely hairless like a Sphinx cat. Besides Iggy Wiggum, his deceased relatives include brother-in-law Fred Kanneke and an uncle who, according to Wiggum, died of ""crotch dot.""
 In ""The Devil and Homer Simpson"", Chief Wiggum has a brief appearance in the ending where he and the other members of the Springfield Police Department are waiting outside the Simpsons' house, obviously in anticipation of tearing chunks of Homer's doughnut-ified head for their morning coffee (a consequence of his narrowly escaping the Devil's snares).
 Wiggum also briefly appears in ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" as part of the PTA meeting on ""Smarch"", where he bore witness to Groundskeeper Willie's grisly demise. When Willie ominously threatened them for leaving him to die, Wiggum jokingly asked if he was going to use ""skeleton power"" against their children in reference to Willie's now-skeletal-like, charred corpse.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XV"", he acted as the yard inspector in London trying to solve the case of the Muttonchop Murderer that was killing several prostitutes. He eventually arrests Homer for the deed, although he was ultimately exposed by Bart and Lisa as being the true Muttonchop Murderer, and attempts to make his escape via hot air balloon, although his escape was foiled by Kang and Kodos. It is later revealed to be a dream by his son that was caused by his ingesting of opium which he revealed to Wiggum, who revealed that it's still a dream.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XXIII"", he was called in to investigate the Simpson House after the family discovered unusual activity inside it because of an unusual flame. He identified it as hellfire, and stated that someone sold their soul to the Devil and that he was expecting his due. However, upon the ring of a cuckoo clock, he ended up turned into a skeleton (presumably by the Devil) and collapsed to dust, although not before warning the family that the Devil feeds on ""more than just fear.""
 It is shown in Professor Frink's future machine that Wiggum will, along with Lou and Eddie, become a Robo-Cop-like machine-officer with a rotisserie in his stomach.
 In ""Flanders' Ladder"", Wiggum dies at age 62 when he chokes on Homer's sub.
 Wiggum laughing at pig's nose although it is similar to his Wiggum appears several times in The Simpsons: Hit and Run video game. The first time is during Level 2, where he attempts to arrest Bart for buying illegal fireworks, intending to place him under five life sentences of community service, although he later seems to forget this as he tells Bart that Herman's Military Antiques was robbed of a radio recently, and suggests that the skid marks from tires would probably lead to the culprit. It is implied in the former mission that he uses his son Ralph in sting operations, at least in regards to the sale of illegal fireworks. He later appears in Level 3 when he is trying to bust Snake Jailbird under the Three Strikes Law, but hasn't gotten any evidence yet due to his being a ""very, very bad cop"" (in his own words). Lisa manages to help him collect evidence to put Snake away in exchange for information in regards to her brother's whereabouts. However, he makes a bigger role in Level 4, where he first asks Marge to collect some donuts which are falling out of a Lard Lad Donuts truck due to suffering a severe case of sugar withdrawal in exchange for giving her information about crop circles, and secondly when he races Marge to 742 Evergreen Terrace after she destroyed several trucks of Buzz Cola (he was particularly upset with Marge for this act, as according to him, Buzz Cola was the only thing that gave him the courage to take his shirt off in the police station locker room).
 Wiggum appears at the end of Bartman Begins to take Principal Skinner away for having the three teenagers rob the museum. He also appears as one of the contestants in the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge in Around the World in 80 Bites. He appears as one of the enemies in Mob Rules, where he tries controlling the mob, mainly by blockading key parts of the town but, in the Xbox and PS3 versions, helping try and protect the statue in the town square. He can also be heard speaking through his megaphone throughout the level and he can always be found in the police station during free roam.
 Chief Wiggum has his own spin-off show in ""The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"" called ""Chief Wiggum P.I."" He is fired from the Springfield force for corruption and moves to New Orleans to start working as a private investigator, with Skinner as his partner. Wiggum and Ralph live in a boat house, and Ralph is kidnapped by a villain called Big Daddy. He later finds his son, and lets Big Daddy escape.
 Chief Wiggum also appears in the video game Lego Dimensions. He is seen during the Chaos when Lord Business's Micro Managers attack Springfield over in front of the Town hall. Chief Wiggum appears in The Simpsons level pack, ""The Mysterious Voyage of Homer"" his role similar to that of the episode it's based on.
 Wiggum is voiced by Hank Azaria on a gruff tone similar to Moe's, however a bit higher and less rough. Azaria first based his voice for Wiggum on David Brinkley, but soon switched it to an Edward G. Robinson impression.
 His surname ""Wiggum"" is Matt Groening's mother's maiden name. As a pun, Wiggum was designed to look like a pig. Many characters, such as Sideshow Bob, have made fun of his pig-like appearance, calling him names such as ""Chief Piggum"".
 Chief Wiggum at the Kwik-E-Mart getting interviewed Ralph was not revealed to be the son of Clancy Wiggum until the episode ""I Love Lisa"", where Ralph seeks advice about his crush on Lisa to Clancy. The writers decided that making Ralph the son of Chief Wiggum would make sense due to similar body types and usual levels of intelligence.

Blue-Haired Lawyer,True,False,False,False,False,2,Castellaneta,28,"The Blue-Haired Lawyer is Springfield's most prominent lawyer known for his pasty face, blue hair, New York accent, and nasal voice.
 His face Mr. Burns on Blue-Haired Lawyer's back. He was first introduced as one of Mr. Burns' many lawyers. Subsequently, he most commonly appears as the lawyer arguing against the Simpsons whenever they wind up in court. He often makes good points against them and wins over the judge. However, he has attempted to aid the Simpson family at least once. He also often appears to serve as a prosecutor.
 He worked for ""Luvum &amp; Burnham: Family Law"" in one episode, where he had a secretary named Uwa (homophone for ""YOU WHA?!?!"").
 His name is never stated, though it's presumably either Luvum or Burnham, given his law firm's name. In one episode, he reveals himself to be the author of a Sci-Fi novel called ""The 60 Foot Baby"" and on the cover he is simply credited as ""Burns' Lawyer.""
 The lawer in ""The Simpsons Movie"" Despite being his lawyer, he is, sometimes, intimidated by Burns. An example of this is when Burns begins losing money, he (and Burns' other lawyers) loses his competence and acts as a yes-man out of fear of his wrath, going as far as to encourage Burns into making bad investments that bankrupt him.
 
He is a member of the Springfield Republican Party.  Past (top right) He graduated from Springfield University.
 Several of him work as The Creator's lawyers/bodyguards.
 In the second segment of the ""Treehouse of Horror XVI"", he questions what gives Mr. Burns the legal right to hunt people. He writes something that ""should work in just about every courtroom"" (and is then shot by Burns).
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XIX"", after Homer kills Krusty the Clown is approached by the lawyer and several businessman.
 He sues the Pawtucket Patriot brewery for copyright infringement.
 Writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss have both stated on the DVD commentaries that the voice is based on McCarthy-era lawyer Roy Cohn, and animator Jim Reardon has said that he is designed to look like character actor Charles Lane.
 If you compare him to Milhouse, he has a striking resemblance to yet another adult version of him: plus, thin glasses and tuxedo and minus the humor, voice, and relationship with a Simpson.
 His voice sounds similar to Louie and Arnie Pye's voices.
 In ""I, Carumbus"", he was shown without his glasses.
 He is one of the few recurring characters in the series we do not yet know the name.

Lionel Hutz,True,False,False,False,False,2,stars,29,"Lionel Hutz, also known as Miguel Sanchez, and also known as Dr. Nguyen Van Phuoc, is a lawyer in Springfield, albeit an incompetent one, and removed from the state bar association. He was always desperate for cases, few of which he won. Hutz was financially insolvent, extremely poor and willing to do nearly anything for money. The character of Lionel Hutz, along with other Phil Hartman characters, was retired after the actor's death.
 He was an inept ambulance chaser and, to quote Lisa, a ""shyster"", whom the Simpsons nonetheless repeatedly hired as their lawyer (a fact remarked on by Marge in a typically self-aware aside) probably because they could not afford a better lawyer anyway. He claimed to have graduated from Princeton school of law, although Princeton hasn't had a law school since the mid-19th century. His legal practice, located in a shopping mall, was named ""I Can't Believe It's A Law Firm!"", ironically not an allowed name for a law firm, suggesting that he is not, in fact, a law firm. He often tried to entice potential clients with free gifts, including a ""smoking monkey"" doll and a business card that ""turns into a sponge when you put it in water."" Lionel Hutz was an occasional person to appear in The Simpsons' lives and sometimes played central roles in events involving them. Marge distrusted Lionel Hutz because he was an incompetent lawyer, even remarking once during a trial ""We really should stop hiring him."" This mistrust worked its way to Hutz's rival known as the Blue-Haired Lawyer who is also aware of his incompetence and greed. During cross-examination, Marge testified against Hutz out of spite because he hired Dr. Riviera, a quack to give out false prognosis and made Bart commit perjury by lying about being in intensive pain when he was fine. Hutz was also briefly married to Selma Bouvier, as when Homer asks her to marry Apu for his citizenship, she says her name with 3 husband names added (Terwilliger, Hutz, McClure) and was long enough without Apu's long surname.
 Hutz is also very greedy and dishonorable shown by how he resorts to any means necessary to make money as well as making attempts to avoid punishments which was shown in ""Selma's Choice"", where he attempted forgery by editing Gladys' will but he was caught by Marge where he then casually admits to forging other people's wills and has been successful (forgery is in fact a very serious crime that can result in 5 years in prison as well as receiving a fine that can range between $250 to $125,000 depending on the seriousness of the crime). Hutz also destroyed his possessions in an attempt to change his identity. Hutz is a cowardly hack, that will gladly commit fraud, bribery, and fabrication in order to gain money.
 Hutz was a recovering alcoholic; also, at one time he hastily left the courtroom after handling a bottle of bourbon in order to consult his A.A. sponsor, musician David Crosby. Also, Hutz referred to bourbon as ""brownest of the brown liquors"" and offered to share with Marge and Homer ""a belt of scotch"" at 9:30AM, explaining that he ""hadn't slept in days.""
 Beyond the law, he also tried his hand at selling real estate. When Homer hired him to babysit the Simpson children, he renamed himself Miguel Sanchez following some trouble that prompted him to change his identity and burn all his personal papers, and he later changed again to Dr. Nguyen Van Phuoc, a Vietnamese name, in addition to Mr. Sanchez. He also won the role as 'Mitch' in the musical adaption of 'A Street Car Named Desire', whilst simultaneously suing the troupe on behalf of the people who were not cast. He may also be a drug dealer, as when Milhouse lands the role of Fallout Boy, Hutz barged up to him and one of the services offered was ""drug deal- errrrrr.... keeper awayer"". He also owns Red Blazer Realty, which employs Cookie Kwan ""Number 1 on the West Side!"", Gil Gunderson (Shelley Levene from 'Glengarry Glen Ross'; as played by Jack Lemmon), and at one point, Marge.  As well, he's been shown to take part-time work as a cobbler, fixing up shoes in his clients' presence and even in court (""Uh, Judge, these won't be ready until Thursday...)
 Hutz law firm I Can't Believe It's A Law Firm!‎. Although Hutz lost almost all of his cases, he did win several cases for the Simpsons, for instance representing Homer in his case against Captain McCallister and The Frying Dutchman restaurant over its ""All You Can Eat"" offer. While the Blue-haired Lawyer tried to show that Homer's eating was far beyond what could reasonably be expected out of an all-you-can-eat offer, Hutz won by putting Marge on the stand and having her reveal the desperate actions she and Homer took after they were kicked out of the restaurant. At Hutz's urging, Marge tearfully admitted that after searching for another All You Can Eat fish restaurant until 3AM, Homer and Marge ""went fishing."" Considering Marge's honest nature, it is unlikely that she was lying. The case was helped by the fact that the entire jury was made up of obese jurors. Captain McCallister then struck a deal with Homer, offering him all he could eat in exchange for using him as a sort of freak show attraction to get more customers.
 Another case he won for one of the Simpsons was when Bart discovered that an old tramp named Chester Lampwick was the real creator of The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show, which was proved by an old drawing by Lampwick. Roger Myers (who had falsely claimed credit for the creation) then had to pay him $800 billion, which forced the Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios to temporarily close down. Although none of this had anything to do with Hutz's skills as a lawyer.
 Hutz also successfully sued Krusty after Bart got appendicitis after eating a piece of jagged metal that was being given away as a prize in his cereal that wasn't even in the safety package all prizes are held in. The case was won, and Bart was given $100,000 in compensation. $99,500 of which was taken by Hutz who'd assembled a team of phony lawyers to make it seem to Bart that it was necessary.

 The following is a list of people whom Lionel Hutz has represented and/or defended in court.
 Hutz additionally represented Homer against the Devil (Ned Flanders). At issue was the rightful owner of Homer Simpson's soul. In a hastily assembled courtroom in the Simpsons' living room, before a jury of the damned, Hutz discussed competently the nature of a contract, although his argument ironically was harmful to Homer. Despite the fact that the contract between Homer and the Devil clearly awarded Homer's soul to the Devil upon Homer's consumption of the 'forbidden doughnut', the jury found a note from Homer to Marge saying that he pledged his soul to her for all eternity thus his soul was not to rightfully give up to the Devil causing them rule in favor of Homer. In retribution for losing the court case, Homer was cursed by the Devil and his head was turned into a giant doughnut. The case was not won so much for Hutz's skill as an attorney, but by Marge's introduction of the relevant evidence (the photo with a note from Homer on the back, granting his soul to Marge).
 In The Simpsons: Hit and Run, there are signs on the Matlock Expressway that advertise the Lionel Hutz Law Firm, which also says, ""30-minute settlements, or your pizza is Free!"".
 The character was retired after Phil Hartman's murder in 1998, as well as his other main character Troy McClure. Hutz made his final speaking appearance in Season 9 episode ""Realty Bites"".
 Since the Simpson family frequently appears in court, other characters have represented the Simpsons in legal matters since the retirement, ranging from just as incompetent to actually knowing what they're doing. For example, in ""Sweets and Sour Marge"", the equally-incompetent Gil stepped in. The Blue-Haired Lawyer has also served as the family's attorney, such as in episodes like ""Orange is the New Yellow"".
 Lionel Hutz still appears infrequently in clip shows and flashbacks, as well as crowd scenes, but only in non-speaking roles. Not counting a cameo in the 750 Characters couch gag in Season 34 finale ""Homer's Adventures Through the Windshield Glass"" (where other retired characters like McClure Edna Krabappel can be spotted), Hutz' last reported appearance was in the Season 27 episode ""The Burns Cage""). Hutz and McClure still sometimes appear in Simpsons Comics, as a voice actor is not needed.

Nick Riviera,True,False,False,False,False,2,Azaria,30,"Dr. Nicholas ""Nick"" Riviera M.D., better known as Dr. Nick, is a recurring character on The Simpsons and a cameo character in The Simpsons Movie.
 Dr. Nick Riviera is a quack physician who studied at dubious medical schools, although he claims to be ""just as good as Dr. Hibbert M.D."". He is inventor of Juice Loosener and Sun &amp; Run. He is also a doctor in charge of vocal chord scraping for Mr. Burns in his weekly treatment to cheat death. Although he seemed to be killed in The Simpsons Movie by a giant shard of glass, he appears in several episodes afterwards, and it was eventually confirmed by Al Jean that the character had not been killed off as many had thought.
 Nick during medical school Riviera is of Hispanic descent and in the European Spanish dub, he is specifically given an Argentinian accent. He has a medical degree from Hollywood Upstairs Medical College (where he apparently spent much of his time using his ability to acquire prescription drugs to impress a succession of attractive women back in the 1970s), and a great deal of luck. Thus far, none of the patients he has swindled, maimed, or given useless or dangerous medical advice seems to have sued him (although a few have come after him in person. For example, a large angry man once grabbed him, and Nick says ""Well, if it isn't my old friend Mr. McGregg — with a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg""; the man has an arm where a leg should be and a leg where an arm should be. Dr. Nick is a stereotypical shady, immoral doctor who performs medical procedures for money with little or no regard for medical ethics, or their patients' well-being. He was once seen digging up corpses in the graveyard for body parts, presumably to use in operations on patients. Although his competence and ethics are frequently called into question, he does have some decent reasoning skills, as he ended up discovering that Mr. Burns' claims of ""Homer Simpson"" after awakening were just a variation of his vegetative state and not actually him identifying his shooter.
 Hi, everybody! He is seen taking a citizenship test, implying he is not a citizen of the United States. Some of his exclamations hint that he may be Argentinian, though there is no direct evidence of this. In ""Homer's Triple Bypass"", he watches a video on how to perform open-heart surgery and is disgusted by all the blood, implying that he may be hemophobic.
 His degrees read ""Mayo Clinic Correspondence School"", ""Club Med School"", ""Female Body Inspector"" and ""I went to medical school for four years and all I got was this lousy diploma"". He frequently appears on infomercials, pitching all sorts of bizarre medical offers, and has often turned his operations into TV spectacles. He is also shown as an inventor/huckster (in the style of Ron Popeil) on the television show I Can't Believe They Invented It! His ""Walk-In Clinic"" is based at; 44 Bow Street. Its phone number is 555-NICK. He can also be called at ] (""The B is for 'Bargain'"").
 He has operated on the Simpson family a couple of times (when they cannot afford Doctor Hibbert) notably when Homer needed a heart bypass. Lisa Simpson attended the live audience for the operation and saved the day by guiding the obviously clueless Dr. Riviera through the operation. He also worked with Hibbert as the anesthesiologist during Bart's appendectomy and showed a large amount of shocking incompetence as he first failed to anesthetize Bart and subsequently passed out from the leaking gas.
 Nick Riviera is crushed by a large shard of glass in The Simpsons Movie During Trappuccino in The Simpsons Movie Dr. Riviera was impaled by a large shard of glass and says ""Bye, everybody!"" and then ""faints"", making him one of the few casualties of the Trappuccino incident. However, he somehow survives, as he appears after the events of the film.
 In The Simpsons Road Rage, he says ""Send me to the hospital, I pretend I work there.""
 A mission in The Simpsons: Hit and Run involves Bart seeking Dr. Nick's monkeys who have run away due to Dr. Nick's treatment of them. He also says a number of things if a player runs him over, such as ""Hey! You drive as well as I practice medicine!"" and ""Don't come crying to me if you need a sex change!"" He also appears in the bonus mission for level three, where Lisa retrieves Principal Skinner's 'personal items'. Dr. Nick says, ""Hello, little girl! Here is the principal's anti-fungal cream!""
 In The Simpsons: Tapped Out, He is a premium character. You can buy him for 90 donuts.
 Dr. Nick appears in The Simpsons Game. Prior to it, he once put Lenny's artificial heart upside down and later gets confronted by Lenny. Dr. Nick just tells him he's a wondering tinker. Lenny says he loves it, and that he wears warm sleeves when it's Winter. Dr. Nick seems happy by it until Lenny says he gave him the wrong brain when he got a brain transplant which he knows he's Lenny but he has all these dreams about a 80 year old French women he's dating. Dr. Nick says he has a lot of brains lying around, so he's not saying he did it, it's just possible.
 Squirrel Nick In ""Treehouse of Horror IX"" segment Hell Toupée Dr. Nick gives Homer a hair transplant.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XIII"", during the final segment Dr. Nick is transformed into a squirrel by Julius Hibbert.
 In the second segment ""Treehouse of Horror XXIV"", Dr. Nick's head get attached to Julius Hibbert.
 In the second segment ""Treehouse of Horror XXV"", he is seen flirting.
 In the final segment ""Treehouse of Horror XXXIV"", Dr. Nick is transformed into Homer as the virus spreads.
 The character design of Dr. Nick is based somewhat on Gábor Csupó, of Klasky Csupo studios, who was originally from Hungary—the animators mistakenly believed Hank Azaria was impersonating Gabor, when in fact the voice was actually a bad imitation of Ricky Ricardo from I Love Lucy.
 His name came from George Nichopoulos, nicknamed Dr. Nick, Elvis Presley's personal physician who was indicted on 14 counts of over-prescribing drugs to Presley and several other patients in the years following Presley's death. While Nichopoulos was acquitted of those charges, his medical license was revoked by the Tennessee medical authorities in 1993.
 Dr. Nick also has a sign in the new HD opening theme that says ""If I kill you, you don't pay"".
 His Business Dr. Nick is notable for his exclamation upon entering a room of ""Hi, everybody!"", which is immediately followed by a response of ""Hi, Dr. Nick!"" from the other characters present with varying degrees of enthusiasm. There was an Austrian version of Dr. Riviera in the episode ""Margical History Tour"", where he portrays the doctor of the ailing Mozart, played by Bart, and his exclamation is ""Guten Tag, everybody!"" Another variation is an episode where Mel Gibson says, ""Hi, everybody!"", and Dr. Nick responds with ""Hi, Mr. Gibson."" Another episode featured a Jewish version of Dr. Nick during Homer's flashback to the first Christmas. Dr. Nick says: ""Shalom, everybody!"" In ""Lisa the Simpson"", Dr. Nick greets a refrigerated Jasper Beardly with ""Hi frozen body!"", when entering the Kwik-E-Mart.
 Note: Most of his appearances are brief background roles. Episodes where he has a role in are in bold.

Booberella,False,False,False,False,False,14,MacNeille,31,"Barbara Jane Lelavinsky, better known by her stage name, Booberella, is an ample-chested vampire-looking woman and a local TV personality in Springfield.
 Booberella hosts late-night monster movies and always dresses in low-cut vampire-style outfits that show lots of cleavage. She is well aware of her large breasts, and constantly draws attention to them, makes reference to them, or tells people to look at them.
 Booberella's trademark, unsurprisingly, is her breast obsession (with her own breasts), in combination with talking like a vampire. For example, when commercial breaks occur in movies that she hosts, she says things like, ""We'll be right back! Then you can see more of my Booooooooobs!"" in a manner reminiscent of Count Dracula saying, ""I want to suck your bloooood!""
 It is unknown if her Romanian accent is fake or not.
 Booberella's show She also once appeared in an interview with Kent Brockman where they were discussing Mr. Burns' recent purchase of Channel 6. When Kent made a statement and was obviously waiting for a reply, there was a long pause, during which Booberella said nothing. Finally, she looked directly into the camera and said, ""Boooobs!""
 Booberella is the daughter of Bill, an employee in the Accounting department at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. She has occasionally been seen dating Duffman.
 When Marge Simpson was taken hostage during a bank robbery, she managed to place a cell phone call to Homer and told him that if she didn't make it out alive, he could get remarried to anyone whose name was on the list in the back of his closet. Booberella was one of the names on the list.
 Booberella also has her own line of handbags.
 Booberella having a date with Duffman. Booberella is a parody of Elvira, who is a spoof of Vampira. She also bears a slight resemblance to Morticia Addams from The Addams Family.
 Booberella's name is likely a play on words of Vampirella and Barbarella, or boobs and Vampirella.

Wendell Borton,True,False,False,False,False,1,MacNeille,32,"Wendell Borton (also known as Wendell Queasly) is a student at Springfield Elementary School.
 Wendell is a boy with albinism who is a classmate of Bart Simpson in Mrs. Krabappel's fourth grade class. He is often seen playing with classmates such as Richard and Lewis, and is also good friends with Martin Prince, and helped him with his election as class president against Bart. He is considered one of the nerds of the school along with Martin, Database and several others, making him a constant and easy target of Nelson and other bullies; however, he might also have some run-ins with the school rules, as he was seen in detention. Wendell was also one of the children who become stranded on the island with his fellow Model UN Club colleagues. His skin color sometimes changes to yellow in the background, such as in ""Little Girl in the Big Ten"", in which he is punched in the stomach by Kearney for lunch money. When the Simpson family get a new trampoline, he is among the kids invited to their place to jump on it, but the trampoline turns out to be hazardous and several kids end up getting hurt, including Wendell. At one point, he falls and exclaims ""My arm!"".
 Wendell about to throw up Wendell is known to have a weak constitution, first shown when he threw up on a bus ride after Bart patted him on the back in ""Homer's Odyssey"". Another time, it's implied that Wendell vomited in the school's hallway, for which he apologized to Groundskeeper Willie, who is seen mopping up the mess left on the floor and behind.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror V"" segment ""Nightmare Cafeteria"", Wendell is among one of the last children not sent to their death along with Ralph and Lisa. However, Edna sends him to the principal's office when his pencil slips off his desk, sealing his fate.
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror X"", he is seen getting his candy inspected at Springfield Elementary School.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XXVI"" segment ""WANTED: Dead Then Alive!"", Bart swings Wendell around 14 times on a roundabout, in a gambling game. However, the latter pukes on 14, thus meaning Bart keeps all the money.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XXVII"" segment Dry Hard is killed by Nelson. In the next segment is seen on the bus.
 In ""Barthood"", he can be seen at Milhouse's graduation party at age eighteen.
 Throughout the series, he has been voiced by Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, Nancy Cartwright and Russi Taylor. This is because of the fact that he rarely speaks and therefore does not have a specific voice actor. His most recent speaking appearance was in THOH 26 where he said he held his puke in on his 14th spin of the merry-go-round. Cartwright used his voice, since he sounded very similar to Todd Flanders. Since Season 1, he is voiced by Jo Ann Harris. From 1991 to 1998, Wendell is voiced by Pamela Hayden. From March 2013 to December 2013, he is voiced by Nancy Cartwright. From 1998 to March 2013, Wendell is voiced by Russi Taylor.

Patty Bouvier,False,True,False,False,False,1,Kavner,33,"Red (Naturally) Patricia Maleficent ""Patty"" Bouvier is one of Marge's cynical chain-smoking twin sisters, who works at the DMV and has a strong dislike for her brother-in-law, Homer Simpson. Patty is a lesbian since she has confessed this to Marge (asking ""did you actually think I was straight?""), appeared on a float at a pride parade, and had tomboy tendencies as a child. She is also the maternal aunt to Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and Ling. She is named after Matt Groening's sister Patty Groening.
 Despite the similarities between her and Selma, Patty has been shown to be more jaded than her sister, particularly towards relationships. Marge once said that Patty chose a life of celibacy, but Selma had it thrust upon her. Patty's decision to not have relationships has been implied to be due to her then-closeted sexuality. When her Aunt Gladys dies, Gladys records in her video will advise to Patty and Selma to get married and have a family. Selma takes this to heart, while Patty seems to pay no attention, remarking that they did well with Gladys leaving them her grandfather clock. She is more vicious to Homer than Selma is, and unlike Selma, who experiences brief moments of kindness to Homer, Patty has no pity for Homer's well-being. Two exceptions occurred, however. The first was when Patty came out of the closet as a lesbian, sucked up her pride and asked Homer (who was legally allowed to perform marriages) to perform the ceremony. The second was when both Homer and Patty were disgusted that Selma got into a relationship with Homer's father Abe, who is twice her age, and they decided to work together to break them up. Other than her occupation at the DMV, she alongside Selma also worked at the Adult Education Annex, where they co-taught a class teaching how girls are to land men. However, because of their grotesque appearances when demonstrating the type of clothes needed to get a man's attention (such as tight, revealing ones), the female classmates are noticeably and understandably disgusted, causing Patty to remind them that there are no refunds should any of the students quit the class by that point. Patty took various classes, including Microwave Cookery and Tai Kwon Do, as she used them as an excuse not to see Principal Skinner, and when he tried to kiss her she used a martial arts move to throw him across the hall.
 Before she came out as a lesbian, she was seen alongside her sister as having a massive fangirl fascination with MacGyver, even going as far as to abduct his actor Richard Dean Anderson, and she also once arranged for a ""gentleman caller"" to arrive by tricking the man, a TV repairman, into thinking there was a broken TV and forced him to ""spend the night"" with them. But it appears that all of those instances were just her going along with what Selma wanted. And after her coming out, the writers basically retconned those story lines out of her.
 Patty alongside her sister Selma is also implied to be somewhat lewd, since, as mentioned above, they were implied to have raped a TV repairman by faking it being broken, had to register for sex offender registration once, and once even rode a horse naked throughout Springfield a 'la Godiva during the first-annual (and only) Do What You Feel festival.
 Patty's fraternal twin sister, Selma Bouvier Patty has come out of the closet as a lesbian (She exclaims ""you could see it from space!""), and hints of her sexual orientation have been dropped many times; as she is seen coming out of a burlesque house. She said  ""There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality"", when Homer runs past her, naked and screaming, and hiding in a closet with Smithers on a parade float in a gay pride parade where the two of them chanted, ""We're gay! We're glad! But don't tell Mom and Dad!"" When Homer heard about Patty coming out, he sarcastically exclaimed ""Patty's gay? Here's another bomb. I like beer!"" It is also implied that she has feelings for Edna Krabappel as she pictures Edna while kissing Homer in order to break Selma and Abe up in the episode Rome-Old and Julie-Eh. She also experimented with her. Before she came out of the closet, she and Selma also ended up doing some sexually lewd deeds such as tricking a TV repairman into acting as a ""gentleman caller"" by unplugging their TV and then claiming it was broken, and she and Selma also had to get into a line for sex offender registration presumably for instances like this (although it is also likely that they picked it because they were not good at picking lines).
 Patty once dated Principal Skinner after he was brought home by Homer. He was intended to be set with Selma, but he fell for Patty instead despite her reluctance (due to Homer mixing up Patty with Selma). Skinner planned to propose to Patty, but although she was flattered, she refused, preferring to stay with Selma, who was on a date with Barney. It is stated by Selma that Patty's date with Skinner was her first date in about twenty-five years. 
 Patty's real hair color After Patty comes out of the closet, Marge is hurt that Patty had hidden her sexuality for years (though there were obvious signs), but learns to respect her sister. Patty wooed a tenured professor of Yale University away from her husband. It is shown she is attracted to Edna Krabappel. Selma says ""I can't face prison"" and Patty suggestively replies ""I can."" Long before coming out, Patty had dated Principal Skinner. She refused to marry him, claiming she was too devoted to Selma as a sister to leave her alone. However, she did consider Principal Skinner a gentleman and had seemed to take it hard that she could not marry him, ending their relationship with the words ""Good night, sweet principal.""  Patty, like Selma, expressed a sexual fixation on MacGyver for many years, (although after she came out it would appear that she was only going along with Selma's feelings for him) even though this aspect of her personality was phased out in later years. Other than MacGyver, she alongside her sister also may have raped a TV repairman. After watching the tail end of Nookie in New York, she commented the female stars' lives was ""so much like  lives,"" implying that, at least before she came out, she did sleep around with multiple men just like Selma. In addition, she also was at least familiar enough with heterosexual relationships that she taught a dating class for single women on how to land men, although thanks to her and her sister's less than appealing appearances, the students were left disgusted with their advice, with Patty opportunistically stating there won't be any refunds if they decide to leave the course.
 Patty's only notable relationship with a woman, however, has been with Veronica, who was a professional golfer. However, it was later discovered by Marge and revealed during Patty's wedding that Veronica was in truth a man named Leslie.When Marge reveals this to Patty, Patty thinks Marge is being homophobic, but Leslie reveals that he is indeed a man. The wedding is called off, and the two sisters make up, with Marge saying that being a lesbian ""doesn't make you less of a bein'"". Patty then goes home with Selma. In the Clown Without Pity segment of ""Treehouse of Horror III"", as Homer runs naked in fear from the evil Krusty Doll, Patty mentions that the last thread of her heterosexuality was torn, possibly an early sign of her sexuality (with Homer unwittingly causing it).
 Patty is the more unpleasant and least empathetic of the two twins (the other being Selma) but she is still close with both her sisters and loves them both dearly. The sisters tend to be cynical and are noted for their addiction to tobacco smoking. They have a strong, mutual (and reciprocated) dislike for Homer as they often make fun of him and are quite quick to point out his faults. She (along with her sister) was born before Homer (and Marge, of course), but their birth date has not been given. It is presumed they are in their mid to late 40s.This is a bit inconsistent, since Lisa says they’re 40 in one episode, yet they are 45 in Tapped Out. But there is a photo of Marge as a baby, yet the twins don’t look much older. However, when Marge was 8, the twins were already teenagers, so they were likely around 15 at the time, and they are also shown as teenagers at camp when the other girls are much younger. Also, Selma has already hit menopause, which usually happens between the late 40s or early 50s. 
 Patty smoking Unlike Homer, who usually makes a perfunctory (if not particularly sincere or committed) effort to be polite to his sisters-in-law out of respect for his wife, Patty and Selma have no hesitation in treating Homer with open rudeness and contempt. There were several instances where they did not seem to care when Homer faced a life-threatening situation. For instance, when Marge rushes to the hospital after receiving a telephone call that Homer had suffered a heart attack at work, Patty and Selma (instead of going to the hospital and comforting Marge in her time of need) remain seated at the kitchen table, continuing their activity of cutting coupons, gasping in amazement at a five cent discount and behaving as though nothing was wrong. They later attempt to set up Marge with a (rather sleazy) friend as a replacement for Homer, regardless of the fact that Homer was still very much alive. Her bad traits have not gone unnoticed by the populace of Springfield and even their family, her mother even stated that "" a sort of evil"", having raised them her entire lifetime.
 When Homer fakes his death, and Patty and Selma show up holding a tombstone inscribed with ""Homer J. Simpson. We are richer for having lost him."" This gift, as well as the fact that they been saving for this since Marge's wedding, causes her to angrily throw them out. The twins then use the tombstone as a coffee table.
 Once, when Homer had to apply for a chauffeur’s license to become a chauffeur so he could pay off a debt he owed them, they purposely failed him to show how much of a loser he was. On this occasion, however, Homer had the last laugh; saving their jobs by pretending their cigarettes were his when they were caught smoking on the job by their superior. Homer then forced them to wipe the debt clean to repay the favor, thus negating his need to earn a chauffeur's license and removing the power they had of Homer.
 Unlike Selma, who on rare occasions is nice to Homer, Patty hates him totally; even when she saw how devastated Marge was when Homer left her to find a better job, she still refused to help them get back together.  The kids also seem to defend their father from Patty and Selma's taunting and insults. For example, when Patty states to Lisa she was just ""Trashing her father"" Lisa sticks up for Homer but Patty did not seem to care what Lisa had to say.
 Patty's favorite brand of cigarettes is identified as ""Lady Laramie 100s"", and her habit had started ""before they were even born"". The sisters share an apartment at the Spinster Arms Apartments and work at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Patty and Selma both smoke in bed and have caused the Spinster Arms Apartments to catch on fire three times. Seen in ""Bart Gets Famous"". They have, on occasion, acted unprofessionally in the course of their jobs, usually when Homer is involved. They allowed Otto to regain his driver's license during Otto's brief tenancy with the Simpson family due to their mutual dislike for Homer.
 Patty is shown on several occasions to be a severe snorer. When Bart and Lisa stay at their apartment, they are shown to be kept awake by Patty's very loud snores. In ”Puffless”, after Selma kicks her out, Patty sleeps in Maggie’s room, which results in Maggie sneaking out. Maggie refers to her as “Extra-Large Mommy”.
 Like her twin sister Selma, Patty is an avid (and sometimes maniacal) fan of the 1980s TV series MacGyver. Regardless of her orientation, she also seems to be erotically aroused by the show and the character, euphemistically needing a cigarette after each viewing of the show. Jay Sherman once tells Patty and Selma that MacGyver is gay; they respond by suspending him from the Simpson home gutter by his underwear. When Richard Dean Anderson tells them he hated playing MacGyver they kidnap him but eventually grow tired of him and get him to leave.
 Patty, along with Selma travel extensively. The twins have on occasion visited Egypt, Mexico, Russia, Easter Island, France, and more mundane places like the Horse Drawn Carriage Museum in Alberta, Canada. They bring back numerous slides, usually to show the Simpson family, but present their vacation slides in the most unenjoyable way possible, such as in “Puffless” when Selma droned on about walking and blister popping during a childhood trip.
 Patty and Selma drive a 1973 or 1974 VW Thing.
 The three Bouvier sisters As children, Patty and Selma were apparently domineering towards Marge and ridiculed her ambition of becoming an astronaut, as well as assaulting her when she told them ""No"" which resulted in her having difficulty with telling anyone no. As children, Patty and Selma both were shown to have very melodic voices and sang very well. When Marge wanted their allowances, they gave them to her, but made Marge do their chores for them. With so much free time, the twins started smoking, causing their trademark rough voices. Their relationship seems to have improved over the years. As adults, the Bouvier twins have a friendly relationship with their sister and frequently visit the Simpsons. They seem relatively fond of their nieces and nephew but seem to like them more when they were younger: ""The older they get, the cuter they ain't."" They have on occasion, watched the kids when their parents were out of town. However, Bart and Lisa would rather not be around when their aunts visit. Their idea of bonding with Lisa includes tutoring her in the belief that men are pigs, using Homer as the prime example.
 Patty seems to have a good relationship with her mother Jacqueline Bouvier, even though Jacqueline describes both Patty and Selma as ""being slightly evil."" Patty is also mentioned as playing the card game Hearts on Tuesday nights with her mother for the last twenty years.
 Her relationship with Homer remains one of mutual hatred. Unlike Selma, who occasionally (though rarely) finds common ground with their brother-in-law, Patty and Homer openly despise each other, and having a relationship which involves a continuous exchange of insults. She unfavorably compares her brother-in-law to a caveman, suggesting him capable of trading Maggie for beer and a nudie magazine. In one episode, she or Selma said, ""Hello everybody except Homer.” Indeed, the one-time Patty and Homer willingly worked together was specifically due to mutual goals of wanting to prevent her sister and his father, respectively from hooking up.
 Selma and Patty have occasionally expressed their common hope that Marge will eventually divorce Homer. They are often quick in pointing out his attempts at infidelity and have unsuccessfully offered to help Marge find a replacement for Homer (although Selma eventually gave in and helped Marge find Homer after seeing how truly unhappy, she was). The twins once went so far as to have a billboard built trying to convince voters to have Homer kicked out of Springfield.
 Their dislike towards Homer has even led to them pushing Homer off a bridge in the episode ""Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind"", although they half-heartedly claim they did this in order to get him to his surprise party, which was conveniently on a boat passing beneath the bridge at the time.
 Homer also openly calls them ugly. He calls them the ""Gruesome Twosome"" behind their backs. One such incident is when Homer sees them working out and calls the sight nauseating. He once said he was blindfolded and ""two sobbing trolls"" threw him on to the lawn. Homer has also called them ""Penis curling she devils"" during a party Marge threw. Homer is known to show little care to what happens to Patty and Selma, unless Marge finds out and gets upset or if there's a benefit for him; for example, when Patty and Selma stopped Homer from getting his chauffeur's license, he smoked their cigarettes to save them from getting fired and in return demands they forgive an earlier loan they gave him for a mortgage payment.
 Series creator Matt Groening said he suggested that Kavner voice Patty and Selma as characters who ""suck the life out of everything...."" Al Jean said Kavner makes Patty's voice more masculine and a lower register, while Selma's voice is a little sweeter.
 Groening also said that he named the Simpsons after his own parents and two younger sisters; he has an older sister named Patty who is an art dealer.
 In ""Future-Drama"", Patty gets a fluffy tail, because of plastic surgery.

They also appear earlier on in Mob Rules as people Marge can use to protest the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy videogame to minors.
 Patty and Selma are seen running the street races in all the levels except level 7, when zombies take over Springfield. They will unlock a bonus car if the player can complete all three street races in each level. They are also responsible for hiring Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum to referee the street races, mostly due to circumstances forcing the three to work for them beforehand (Milhouse due to needing a license to ride his bike, Nelson due to court-mandated community service due to selling bootlegged CDs, and Ralph due to his father demanding he work there as punishment for acting out in a store). When completed, the two make disparaging comments regarding the winner. In levels 2 and 5, they can be seen working at the DMV. The player can talk to them whilst inside the DMV.

Selma Bouvier,False,True,False,True,True,1,Kavner,34,"Selma Bouvier-D'Amico (née Bouvier; previously Terwilliger, Hutz, McClure, Discothèque, and Simpson) is one of Marge's older chain-smoking twin sisters. She works at the DMV and possesses a strong dislike for her brother-in-law, Homer, although on extremely rare occasions she shows kindness towards him and seems to tolerate him. She seems to despise Homer slightly less than her twin sister, Patty Bouvier.
 Selma Bouvier was born two minutes before Patty. Due to a childhood bottle rocket accident, she lost her sense of taste and smell.
 Selma's favorite film actor was reportedly Troy McClure, to whom she was briefly married, before discovering that it was just a publicity stunt by McClure. McClure took it one step further by wanting to have a child with Selma to help his career. Selma was willing to live a sham for a while but broke it off when she realized that she couldn't bring a child into a loveless marriage.
 According to Marge, Selma is ""the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days."" Selma inherited her deceased Aunt Gladys's iguana, Jub-Jub, instead of her mother, Jacqueline, due to Jacqueline's dislike of Jub-Jub. Unlike Patty, Selma is very desperate to find love after seeing her Aunt Gladys' video will. She also asks Marge for advice to find love, saying that Patty is two minutes younger than she is.
 Selma's sister, Patty Bouvier Selma's favorite brand of cigarettes is identified as ""Laramie Hi-Tars"" while Patty's favorite brand of cigarettes is ""Lady Laramie 100s""; they have been claimed by their mother to ""have started smoking even before birth"". It is shown that Patty and Selma started smoking as children when they gave their allowances to Marge (she would do their chores), and with all the free time they had, they took up smoking. The twins had melodic voices prior to starting smoking, and their trademark harsh voices after . On two instances, Selma has smoked cigars , and once tried vaping as a substitute for smoking in the Simpson house, the latter of which she did not enjoy . The smoke and ash from the cigarettes turned her hair grey, originally blond. Since Patty is not a blond, but a redhead, this would make them fraternal twins. Patty and Selma share an apartment at the Spinster City Apartments complex and work at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). They have on numerous occasions acted unprofessionally in the course of their jobs, such as smoking indoors, giving out licenses to unqualified drivers, or flirting with the customers (although Patty was eventually revealed to be a lesbian and didn't tell Marge right away due to fear of Marge's reaction. While Marge seems unsure at first, she eventually accepts Patty after saving her from a fraudulent marriage).
 Selma and Patty have an avid (sometimes maniacal) love of the television show MacGyver. Selma nearly broke off her engagement with Sideshow Bob because he disliked the show, and both Patty and Selma stay up until 2:00 in the morning to watch the show. Patty and Selma also have an interest in traveling. They have visited Egypt, Lenin's Tomb in Russia, Easter Island, France, Mexico, and more mundane places, such as the Remington Horse Drawn Carriage Museum in Cardston, Alberta, Canada. Selma has also been to Duff Gardens. When they return home, they bring back numerous slides of them in these locations, and show them to the Simpson family, often describing the events in the most enjoyable way possible. The family, especially Bart and Lisa, are shown as barely staying awake during these shows. During a slideshow of a childhood vacation with their father, the twins learn that he actually died from lung cancer. They question why their mother let them smoke, to which she sadly replies, ""I thought it made you look cool."" The twins try to quit, but Patty relapses, leading Selma to toss her out. Patty ends up staying at the Simpsons house. The two then reconcile after realizing how bad the apartment smells, which leads to them smoking again.
 After a trip to Paris, the twins visit the Simpsons, but Marge doesn't want them smoking around the children. The twins try electronic cigarettes but hate the taste. They then sneak their real cigarettes into the bathroom, but due to a fracking incident, the sink sets their hair on fire and then sets off the sprinkler. Homer catches the two attempting to smoke, and they go upstairs to change.
 Selma claimed that she would switch to chewing tobacco before adopting Ling. However, Selma does still smoke, just not around Ling.
 Patty and Selma smoking Selma and Patty tend to be cynical and are noted for their addiction to tobacco smoking. In one episode during Season 26, they temporarily live with Homer. Homer places a ban on smoking, so instead, they smoke electric cigarettes, which they hate. Selma has presumably switched to chewing tobacco after adopting Ling, although the episode ""Puffless"" disproves this. They have a strong, mutual (and reciprocated) dislike for their brother-in-law. Selma and Patty are shown to be older than Homer and Marge, but a birth date has not been given. It is presumed they are in their mid to late 40s since Selma has gone through menopause and the twins are shown as preteens or teenagers when Marge is around Lisa's age. She enjoys getting foot massages as she is shown getting them constantly. She weighs 168 pounds exact and is considered overweight like Patty, though they are not as fat as Homer. As teenagers and children, they are average weight, while Homer was still fat.
 Patty and Selma uninterested in Homer's serious condition Unlike Homer, who usually makes a perfunctory (if not particularly sincere or committed) effort to be polite to his sisters-in-law out of respect for his wife, Patty and Selma do not have hesitation in treating Homer with open rudeness and contempt. There were several instances where they did not seem to care when Homer faced a life-threatening situation. For instance, when Marge rushes to the hospital after receiving a telephone call that Homer had suffered a heart attack at work, Patty and Selma — instead of going to the hospital and comforting Marge in her time of need — remained seated at the kitchen table, continuing their activity of cutting coupons, gasping in amazement at a five cent discount and behaving as though nothing was wrong. They later attempted to set up Marge with a (rather sleazy) man as a replacement for Homer, regardless of the fact that Homer was still very much alive.
 When Homer faked his demise to get out of work, Patty and Selma showed up at the Simpsons house holding a tombstone inscribed with ""Homer J. Simpson. We are richer for having lost him."" This gift as well as the fact that they been saving this since Marge's wedding causes her to throw them out. When Homer was revealed to be alive, the twins use the tombstone as a coffee table. It should also be noted that in the beginning of the series, Patty and Selma's catchphrase was, ""Marge, why did you ever marry him""? And then listed one single reason why he is a terrifying husband. In a 1997 Treehouse of Horror segment entitled ""Easy Bake Coven"", they mockingly refer to Homer as ""Durwood"" and show glee at Marge having to leave her family. They then try to eat children but are offered sweets in exchange for the children's lives. Marge then says that they shouldn't have filled up on kids before getting to the Flanders house. This is apparently how trick-or-treating started.
 Selma pretending to be married to Homer. Despite this, Selma occasionally (though very rarely) shows fonder feelings for him; a prime example is in ""Selma's Choice"", when Selma takes Bart and Lisa to Duff Gardens and is worn out due to them running off and Lisa becoming drugged, later expressing admiration for Homer's ability to cope with the kids. On another occasion Homer left Marge to try to find a better job to give her what she deserved, and Patty and Selma rejoiced, but when she saw how unhappy Marge Selma was gave in and told her where Homer was working. Selma also pretended to be married to Homer so she could adopt Ling, since the adoption agency frowns upon single parents. When it is revealed that the head of the agency was herself raised by a single parent, she allows Selma to keep Ling.
 Homer, for his part, despises the twins just as much as they dislike him, but he has shown occasional bouts of kindness towards them, and Selma in particular (much to their surprise). He does this more because of his love for Marge than for any love for his in-laws. One example is, when Sideshow Bob was running for mayor, Homer voted for him just because there was a Selma-killing policy. Another example is, Homer once made fun of the fact that Patty was a lesbian, pointing out the obvious by saying ""Here's another bomb: I like beer!"".
 Selma's bad traits have not gone unnoticed by the populace of Springfield and even their family; her mother even stated that "" a sort of evil"", having raised them her entire lifetime.
 Patty and Selma also rarely shave their legs for some reason, although this isn't always shown, given that both twins wear dresses that expose their (hairless) legs. Also, they have been shown in swimsuits without leg hair. In Tapped Out, Selma is only hairy above shin level, although it's normal for females to have hairy thighs. Selma alongside her sister Patty is also implied to be somewhat lewd, as they were implied to have raped a TV repairman by faking it being broken, had to register for sex offender registration once, and once even rode a horse naked throughout Springfield a'la Godiva during the first-annual (and only) Do What You Feel festival.
 Selma wearing her ""S"" earrings. She is tall and overweight with a similar body type to Patty. She wears a blue sleeveless dress and round earrings. Her hair is long and curly, worn in an m-shape (although she wore different hairstyles when she was younger, it's always been longer than Patty's). She is actually a blonde, in contrast to Patty's red hair, meaning that they are in fact fraternal twins. The gray coloring is from cigarette ashes. On special occasions, Selma will wear earrings in the form of the letter ""S"", further distinguishing her from her twin, who wears triangle earrings.
 A running joke is that Selma was physically ugly, such as when helping her sister Patty teach an adult education course for single women on how to land men by wearing tight revealing clothes, the female students were left disgusted at Selma's appearance. Similarly, her attempt at a dating video resulted in her being rejected by even the likes of Groundskeeper Willie, himself not above sexually lewd elements, where he said ""back to the Loch with ye, Nessie!"" before turning off the video; and her accidentally sunbathing topless thanks to Bart using a falcon to steal her top prompted a presumed Beach proprietor to promptly close the beach permanently out of disgust at her appearance.
 Despite being twins, Patty and Selma have very different track records when it comes to finding dates. According to Marge, Patty chose a life of celibacy (possibly because she's a lesbian), while Selma had celibacy thrust upon her. Selma is a heterosexual. Her standards are extremely low, as evidenced by her comments on Mr. Burns: ""Single, eh? Well, he passes the Selma Test,"" despite him being old enough to be her great-grandfather. Oddly, she was grossed out when Hans Moleman tried to kiss her.
 Selma has actively sought out a husband, having been married a total of five times (that we know of). Her current name has evolved into Selma Bouvier-Terwilliger-Hutz-McClure-Discothèque-Simpson-D'Amico, after failed marriages to Sideshow Bob, Lionel Hutz, Troy McClure, Disco Stu ,and Abraham Simpson. She thought she married (Fit) Fat Tony, because she didn't understand Italian -- and didn't realize the ceremony was for her to become his ""goomar"" (mistress), rather than his wife.
 The ""Evidence"" One person Selma refused to marry was Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, because she said her collection of last names was long enough without Nahasapeemapetilon added to it. Selma claimed that she would only marry for love, or possibly money in the future. There is photographic evidence that she slept with Apu after Homer and Marge's second wedding (presumably in Bart's bedroom, due to various belongings belonging to Bart Simpson and Bart impatiently and irritably looking at his watch while watching them sleep). Selma later began dating and later married Grandpa Simpson, who had previously dated her mother (which, if the two were married, would have made Marge and Homer step-siblings). Eventually, however, the couple realized that they are unable to make it work because of his age and her career and called it quits. Also, this would have made her briefly Homer's stepmother.
 Selma has also dated Hans Moleman, Moe Szyslak, and pitifully, Barney Gumble. She also, alongside Patty before the latter came out of the closet, did some sexually questionable actions (possibly rape) such as tricking a TV repairman into acting as a ""gentleman caller"" by unplugging their TV set and then claiming it was broken, as well as going into a line for sex offender registration once with Patty, although whether this was due to mistaking the line for another line or if they did sexual actions to deserve sex offender registration is never specified. They have also flashed their cleavage a few times. Their sexuality is also shown in a futuristic episode, where Patty has a female love-bot, while Selma's is male. In another future montage, the twins are shown as old women hooked to machinery from smoking-related diseases until they eventually die. A baby photo of the two shows them sucking on candy cigarettes.
 Unable to find companionship in a husband, Selma has also sought to have children. At one point she was considering using a sperm donor. After babysitting Bart and Lisa for a day, she realized that although she wanted someone to love, she was not ready to have children and wound up adopting Jub-Jub, her Aunt Gladys's pet iguana. Later, however, a very menopausal Selma adopted a Chinese baby, Ling Bouvier. During the adoption process, Selma pretended to be married to Homer, since the Chinese government only allows children to be adopted by married couples. When the fraud was exposed, Selma managed to keep the baby, as a Chinese dignitary who had also been raised by a single parent became sympathetic.
 Selma's real hair color As children, Selma and her sister Patty were apparently domineering towards Marge and ridiculed her ambition of becoming an astronaut. Their relationship seems to have improved over the years. As adults, the Bouvier twins have a friendly relationship with their sister and frequently visit the Simpsons. They seem relatively fond of Maggie, Lisa, and Bart, but seem to like them more when they are young: ""The older they get, the cuter they aren't."" They have, on occasion, watched the kids when their parents were out of town. However, Bart and Lisa would rather not be around when their aunts visit. They once spend a nightmarish weekend with their aunts, making Bart and Lisa appreciate Marge when she returns. Their idea of bonding with Lisa includes tutoring her in the belief that men are pigs, using Homer as the prime example. Also, Selma was responsible for Lisa getting drugged at Duff Gardens, although Selma is remorseful once she witnesses Lisa's crazed behavior. Lisa shows up naked, wet, high, and in a towel, shouting ""I AM THE LIZARD QUEEN!"" A random man gives Selma a pile of pills to give to Lisa. Lisa returns home, groggy from the pills and still in a towel.
 Their relationship with Homer remains one of mutual dislike (although Selma gradually grows to become more tolerant towards Homer and often experiences brief moments of kindness from both Homer and Selma, but, these examples are far and few between) which involves a continuous exchange of insults from day one. They unfavorably compare their brother-in-law to a caveman, suggesting him capable of trading Maggie for beer and a nudie magazine.
 Selma and Patty have occasionally expressed their common hope that Marge will eventually divorce Homer. They have unsuccessfully offered to help Marge find a replacement for Homer. The twins went so far as to have a billboard built trying to convince voters to have Homer kicked out of Springfield. One time, they even managed to have the audacity to not only unveil a tombstone for Homer that tastelessly inferred that they're richer now that he died, but admitted they've saved up for the tombstone since their wedding day after he was believed to have died, causing Marge to kick them out of the house out of disgust.
 Their hostility towards Homer has even led to pushing him off a bridge, although they halfheartedly claim they did this in order to get Homer to his surprise party, which was conveniently on a boat passing beneath the bridge at the time. Unsurprisingly, Homer expresses glee over their deaths in the Treehouse of Horror episodes, even taping Marge's hair to a deceased Patty's head in an attempt to fool God in ""Reaper Madness"".
 Selma once took the Simpson kids on a disastrous trip to the Duff Gardens theme park. Unable to control the children, Bart manhandles several animatronic characters and sneaks on a ride that he is not old enough for, and Lisa goes on a psychedelic trip after drinking ""water"" from an It's a Small World - like boat ride at Bart and Selma's beckoning, the latter mostly to shut Bart up due to the two entering an argument caused by Bart's dare (later swimming naked in the Fermentarium and exclaiming ""I am the lizard queen!""). After that, however, Selma returned home with the children and asked Homer how he does it, referring to raising children. She mentioned children and they exchanged a hug, implying that Selma is slightly more capable of overcoming her dislike of Homer than Patty.
 At age 55, Selma threatens to stuff Edna Krabappel's hat down her throat if she catches the bouquet at ""Lisa's Wedding"". This episode is not canon since it aired before Edna's death and in real time, Edna would not have been at the wedding.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", at age 72, she has a love-bot, who runs away with Patty's love bot, much to their annoyance.
 Patty and Selma in old age At the end of ""Flanders' Ladder"", Selma is one of many wives of Ned Flanders.
 In the opening ""Treehouse of Horror XX"", Selma is shown with a mummy at Marge's Halloween party.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XXX"", during the final segment Selma falls in love with an alien named Kang and helps him escape captivity with the support of Homer. Pursued, they met his sister Kodos at the top of Mt. Springfield. Selma is shot and killed by pursuing soldiers and Kang manages to the soldiers to dust by using the The Infinity Gauntlet. Kang resurrects Selma by telling her that she is pregnant. Patty then arrives as Kang, Kodos, and Selma are about to leave Earth, but Patty begs her not to do so however Patty falls in love Kodos after admitting their sexual preference to one other. They honeymoon together with the twins nagging their spouses.
 In this episode she portrays an English Queen Elizabeth I, who is in search of a man, and eventually settles for Sir Walter Raleigh, who likes one of her ladies in waiting, played by Marge. Meanwhile, a rejected King Julio of Spain, wants his revenge, and sends his armada to England and the Elizabethan Armada catches on fire thanks to Sir Walter Raleigh and his smoking pipe, soon the English Armada abandon the ship and the flaming boat defeats the Spanish Armada, Raleigh is granted an honor and has permission to marry the Lady In Waiting. She proclaims: ""I don't need a man, whereas I have England"", to which Moe replies ""You keep telling yourself that"".
 Patty and Selma appear in the level NeverQuest in the form of a two-headed dragon who attack the Hobbit-like forms of Rod Flanders, Todd Flanders, and Ralph Wiggum. They also appear earlier on in Mob Rules as people Marge can use to protest the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy video game to minors.
 Patty and Selma are seen running the street races in all the levels except level 7, when zombies take over Springfield. They will unlock a bonus car if the player can complete all three street races in each level. They are also responsible for hiring Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum to referee the street races, mostly due to circumstances forcing the three to work for them beforehand (Milhouse due to needing a license to ride his bike, Nelson due to court-mandated community service due to selling bootlegged CDs, and Ralph due to his father demanding he work there as punishment for acting out in a store). When completed, the two make disparaging comments regarding the winner. In levels 2 and 5, they can be seen working at the DMV. The player can talk to them whilst inside the DMV.
 Matt Groening has mentioned that he named the Simpsons after his own parents and two younger sisters; he has an older sister named Patty who is an art dealer. Julie Kavner has proclaimed that she had difficulty coming up with the voices for the Bouvier sisters until producer James L. Brooks suggested that she voice Patty and Selma as characters ""that suck the joy out of everything"".

Charles Montgomery Burns,True,True,False,True,False,1,Collins,35,"
 Charles Montgomery Plantagenet Schicklgruber Burns, also known as Monty Burns, Montgomery Burns, C.M. Burns, and Mr. Burns, is the owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in The Simpsons franchise. He is Springfield's richest, oldest (supposedly), most powerful, and undoubtedly greediest and meanest citizen. His net worth has been stated to be in the billions and in one instance was pegged at exactly $1,800,037,022.
 He had, on four occasions, lost his entire fortune, and on another occasion sold his Power Plant. At another time his fortune slipped to ""only"" $996 million ($996,036,000), leading to his expulsion from Billionaire Camp. Despite his proficiency with firearms, Burns is very elderly and physically frail but employs relentless and ruthless tactics to get whatever he wants.
 Young Burns in with his teddy bear, Bobo. Charles Montgomery Burns's birthday is September 15. His age and time of birth varied depending on which account was given. In 1909 he appeared as a small child. He once mentioned surviving the Titanic by making a raft out of steerage passengers. In one episode he graduated from college in 1914 and attended the 25-year reunion in 1939. However, in another episode, he was a child in 1913, and in a different episode he was a child in 1935. In another episode, he was a wealthy tycoon in the 1920s who used his wealth to hold excessive parties in his Middle Hampton mansion and described by Homer Simpson's narration as ""the last tycoon of the Jazz Age"". In another episode's flashback, Burns was a young man in Paris ""between the wars"". He mentioned last checking his stocks in September 1929, living through five years of ""McKinley-omics"", and meeting Calvin Coolidge. He appeared as an old man terrorizing children in a 19th-century woodcut. In the 1990s, he gave his age to Homer as 81, although other people in the 1990s and 2000s including Homer understood his age to have been 104. In the 2000s, his age was large enough to be a four-digit personal identification number, and he gave his place of birth as Pangaea. When the 108-year-old Cornelius Chapman died in 2000, Burns officially became Springfield's oldest living resident. In the 2010s, Burns told Homer his age has four digits. Burns implied he was rounding down his actual age, whichever it was, to 89, when after mistaking a eulogy for the millennia-old Geezer Rock for himself, Burns said, ""I have been 89 for a while now."" During the musical number ""Thanks for the Currency"" in Burns' dream, Burns told George Washington that he was present at the Revolutionary War. Homer once narrated that Burns was a man who dated Betsy Ross.
 As a child, Burns lived happily with his natural parents, Clifford and Daphne Burns, and his teddy bear Bobo. He was described as either the older brother of George Burns, or the youngest of eleven siblings, all of whom aside from Montgomery Burns himself died young. As a child, Burns was so jubilant and amiable that his parents called him ""Happy"", though accounts disagreed on whether his own parents were happy as well or cold and distant. How he left his parents varied depending on the account. According to some early episodes, at a young age, he left his parents, and Bobo, to live with a twisted and heartless billionaire, who was his grandfather, Wainwright Montgomery Burns, the owner of the Springfield Power Works, where laborers split atoms by hitting anvils with sledgehammers. In another episode, his parents were rich and sent him to boarding school on Christmas Day, which left him heartbroken as he had previously asked a mall Santa Claus for a hug from his mother and a smile from his father. According to Sideshow Bob, disguised as Santa, this was to toughen him up and make him a ruthless tycoon as a better expression of love than with hugs and kisses. When Burns returned home, his parents had died, and it was too late for him to hug them, although yet another episode described his mother as living to be at least 122 years old in the 1990s (after Burns failed to murder her five decades prior to that for her extramarital affair with President William Howard Taft). He also listed the cause of his parents' deaths during a medical check up as ""got in my way"", and in another episode claimed that the lack of indoor plumbing killed his mother, again suggesting she had died well before the 1990s. Accounts varied as to whether Burns inherited his fortune, or if he gained it from the nuclear power business or by hanging onto the song ""White Christmas"". According to one episode, Burns first came to Springfield when Marge Simpson and Moe Szyslak were children, while other episodes show him living in Springfield in the 1900s, 1910s, and 1920s.
 Burns attended Yale University, where he studied science and business, played on the varsity football team, and was inducted into the Skull and Bones secret society.
 After becoming a CEO with a power tie and a bonsai tree, Burns got a book contract to write the business advice guide called The Rungs of Ruthlessness.
 Burns' social security number is 000-00-0002. Once, while filling it in, he muttered to himself, ""Damn Roosevelt.""
 At Burns' Yale University reunion, he had an affair with the daughter of an old flame named Lily Bancroft. She would later bear his long-lost child, Larry Burns, who was given up for adoption and would later enter Burns' life briefly.
 After Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Burns joined the SS. However, Burns defected and fled Germany. Because of his American heritage, he returned to the United States in 1941, just days after the US declared war on Germany, and enlisted in the U.S. Army.
 
 Burns served in the Flying Hellfish during World War II, holding the rank of private after being demoted for his involvement in a romantic scandal and attempting to block a probe from J. Edgar Hoover. Burns is proud of having manufactured shells for the Nazis, seeing himself as being superior to Oskar Schindler because his shells ""worked, dammit!"".
 Burns and Abraham Simpson II during WWII A member of Springfield's Flying Hellfish battalion, he saw action in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge, serving under Sergeant Abraham Simpson II. He was later transferred to the South Pacific with part of his squad. During the closing years of the war, when his platoon was clearing out a German-occupied castle, Burns came across several valuable portraits. Since they could not choose on who they should go to, they planned to enter into a tontine, from which Burns was removed after the war through being dishonorably discharged when he tried to kill Abe. The paintings were later handed back to a German whose relatives owned them.
 At the end of World War II, he was personally hired by President Harry Truman to transport a specially-printed trillion-dollar bill to Europe as the United States' contribution to the reconstruction of the continent. As the United States' richest citizen, Burns was thought to be also the most trustworthy, which turned out to be just a false rumor. Subsequently, Europe had never managed to reconstruct and Burns absconded with the bill and kept it in his possession for many years until it was lost to Fidel Castro.
 Burns, along with the Flying Hellfish, served in the Korean War.
 
 A mural was painted of Burns being driven out of Cuba in 1959, although on another occasion he was unaware President Fulgencio Batista was gone.
 By the time Homer Simpson was about six or nine, Burns was the chairman of the Germ Warfare Laboratory at Springfield University. By that point, peace activists, including Homer's mother Mona, destroyed all of the germs in the laboratory with antibiotics. He still had a chair on the university's board many years after Homer left high school.
 When Homer Simpson was either 12 or in his senior year of high school, Burns opened the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant with his assistant, Waylon Smithers Sr. Soon after, the plant suffered a meltdown, and almost exploded. Smithers Sr. chose to sacrifice himself to save the plant, along with his son and town. Burns currently owns the plant, although he has parted with it several times, including when he sold it to German investors (Hans, Fritz, and Horst), when the bank foreclosed on it and put Lenny Leonard in charge, when Burns lost his possessions to Rich Texan in a scavenger hunt game, and when Jay G tricked Burns into bankrupting himself by overspending on a credit card. He was also close to selling the plant when Elon Musk's changes to the plant caused Burns to lose his fortune, but this was averted after Burns struck uranium deal with a Nigerian King. The plant was also legally owned at one point by a canary bird named Canary M. Burns to protect Mr. Burns from responsibility for any wrongdoing by the power plant. At some point during his ownership of the plant, Mr. Burns apparently recruited a Brazilian soccer team to work at the nuclear power plant's reactor core after their plane had crashed in front of his property (an act that was against the laws of the Department of Labor), as well as hiring a duck named Stewart.
 This record will include crimes committed by Waylon Smithers, but planned by Burns.
 Burns is a tall, slightly hunchbacked man with a prominent overbite and a long beak-like nose. He is thin to the point of being skeletal, since his spine and ribcage are visible. Despite this, he has outlived many of Springfield’s residents.
 Mr. Burns in his typical evil mood Mr. Burn's personality classification is that he is a sadistic, cold, life-hating ecological terrorist with a sadistic passion for autarchy. He has an incurable process addiction of devising destructive, disruptive, life-hating plots for his own gain. Mr Burns personally enjoys the dehumanization of new, creative, bright employees because he ignores how that dehumanization relates to his profits. Mr. Burns' main conflict with himself is his musculoskeletal condition is so bad, that he is constantly achy and he is generally of poor and low character. Mr. Burns never took his billions of dollars to buy any class for himself. Mr. Burns embodies a number of sometimes accurate stereotypes about Corporate America, as he has an unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power. Burns also embodies the stereotype of a manager by forgetting his employees' names (especially Homer's, despite Homer appearing that he interacts more than Burns does with most of his employees), though this can be attributed to his senility. Burns is also unconcerned for their safety and well-being (the plant, for example, is filled with obvious safety violations).
 Burns kissing Mr. Teeny Because Burns has become like an authoritarian bloated tick operator in his local economy, he is incredibly greedy as well as incredibly short-tempered, the latter trait being best demonstrated by his often releasing his attack dogs, the hounds, on those requesting charity. He uses his wealth on absurdly extravagant things, such as a life-size chess set (with humans as pieces), using the town's snow plows to play a soccer-type game, and having ""money fights"" with Smithers. Also due to his riches, Mr. Burns is very stingy and averse to rewarding good deeds with money. His exact status on his stinginess has varied, however, especially when made to pay fines. When undergoing a state-level nuclear inspection, Mr. Burns when learning the cost to pay off the 342 safety violations to get rid of them as being $56 million got so incensed and depressed at having to pay the fines (with his exact reaction implying the possibility that he didn't have that amount of cash on him) that he proceeded to drink himself to a stupor until Homer suggested he run for governor. On the other hand, when he was made to pay a $3 million fine for illegally dumping nuclear waste in a public park, Mr. Burns largely took the whole thing in stride, casually telling Smithers to get his wallet out of his restraints' pocket, and then offered to take the Justice statue in exchange (with Roy Snyder agreeing to these terms). It is heavily implied that the reason why Mr. Burns was vicious towards his own employees and presumably most of Springfield if not all of humanity is because his employees and possibly everyone else have frequently abused his trust to goof off earlier.
 Mr. Burns struggles to understand Ketchup and Catsup Burns appears to be completely removed from modern conventions and, sometimes, reality. Although he is evil, he sometimes loses his train of thought completely, becoming a helpless old man and sometimes actually a nice, caring person. He continually fails to remember who Homer is, despite the two having interacted extensively throughout the series. Not even Homer spray-painting ""I AM HOMER SIMPSON"" on Burns' office wall was sufficient to get Burns to remember Homer's name, this incident only resulting in an altercation. In addition, Mr. Burns, when planning his Sun Blocker plan shortly after firing Smithers, and while literally stomping down on potential rivals at his model of Springfield, proceeded to stamp down on one of the cooling towers of the plant and yell ""Take that, Springfield Nuclear Power Pl..."" before realizing that the plant was actually already under his control and then sheepishly muttered, ""Oh, fiddlesticks!""
 Burns is also, for the most part, unaware of the townspeople's general hatred of him. He also tends to be extremely selfish and does not even seem to realize or even care about his selfish actions. However, he also had redeemable traits despite his status as a villain; He was good friends with Simon Woosterfield, and gave Bart advice on what was going on in his family (although at that time, he had mistaken Bart for Simon due to the two switching places), and he also once supplied his workers, as part of Employee Appreciation Day, a trip to the drag racing track, although this largely backfired when Lenny Leonard, while drunk, inadvertently terrorized Mr. Burns when trying to thank him for the great evening. He also willingly allowed Smithers to take a week off from the Power Plant and presumably his duties as Mr. Burns' primary caregiver to perform in a Malibu Stacy musical he wrote and directed at the Alburquerque Theater in New Mexico, despite his personally thinking that the play would fail due to its subject matter, and earlier also prevented Smithers from drowning himself in a mental breakdown from perceived failure in defending him or doing basic duties and even suggested he take a vacation. Once, he even aided Marge in an attempt to protect Springfield's children from Lindsey Naegle's anti-child group (although it's implied that he had more selfish motives for backing the group, as he needed the children's' ""supple young organs"" to stave off death).
 He is also shown to hate the lawyers he hires in large part because of the latter party's unethical practices, and only has them available under necessity. At one point, in an uncharacteristic act of charity, he also managed to pay for a then-dangerously overweight Homer Simpson's liposuction to make him comparatively thin again to repay the latter for reducing a potentially catastrophic Chernobyl-style nuclear meltdown at the plant to ""a mere Three-Mile Island"" (although it should be noted that he did this task after Homer failed to do one sit-up). In addition, during Frank Grimes' last moments when he, having entered a psychotic break, ended up grabbing extremely high voltage cables under the delusion that he was Homer Simpson, Burns was seen grimacing at the result alongside Homer Simpson, Smithers, and at least two other workers. In addition, Mr. Burns when watching a play Skinner organized to get him to provide funds for the then-recently closed Springfield Elementary School, reacted with horror after the Chef, out of incompetence caused by the school being closed, placed rat poison into broth instead of salt, before Skinner pointed out that Mr. Burns could have ingested it. Similarly, when Homer had a manatee pose as himself, Mr. Burns was shown to befriend him, and when learning he was about to die from dehydration, he immediately requested they give the manatee a sponge bath.
 Burns also proceeded to make sure Homer went to college for a Nuclear 101 course so that he can be allowed to keep his job, even going as far as to use his holding a chair at Springfield University to pull several strings to make sure he was enrolled (though it should be noted that he mostly did it for somewhat selfish reasons, as he implied that if Homer did not go to college, then the nuclear power plant would be shut down as a result of Homer's incompetence). He also organized a team-building exercise upon witnessing first hand his employees failing to clear the power plant during a fire drill within at least fifteen minutes (especially when the optimal clearance time was forty-five seconds), and was genuinely disgusted with his employees' actions beforehand (in particular, Homer blocking the fire escape with a bench). In addition, when Homer was revealed to have had mental trauma caused by his accidental discovery of Waylon Smithers, Sr.'s half-decayed corpse in a local watering hole that he was swimming at that got re-exposed during a hypnotist session, Mr. Burns also supplied a videotape explaining how Waylon Smithers, Sr. died to help Homer recover from the trauma (although he also largely did it because they assumed that Mr. Burns had him murdered due to the place where Smithers' body was discovered being connected directly to Mr. Burns' office, with the alternative being facing jail time, and thus wanted to clear his own name as well.).
 Smithers kissing Mr. Burns Mr. Burns uses archaic phrases and antiquated expressions that have either changed meanings or fallen out of common usage in American English, including score (meaning 20), post-haste (quickly), petroleum distillate (gasoline), gay (jolly, which also caused Smithers quite a scare due to the latter initially thinking he asked if he was going to do a homosexual activity during the weekend), dean (principal), velocitator and deceleratrix (a car's accelerator and brake), jumping box and picto-tube (television), Automated Telemachineomeratron (Automated Teller Machine/ATM), Suffragette (Feminist),  auto-gyro (helicopter), and the New York Nine (New York Yankees). His use of ""ahoy-hoy"" when answering the telephone follows the suggestion of its inventor, Alexander Graham Bell, who felt ""ahoy"" should be the initial greeting instead of ""Hello"". He also calls Smithers and says ""Smithers, come here, I want you"", a take on what are reputedly the first words spoken by Alexander Graham Bell on his telephone (""Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.""). On a similar note, he also sometimes uses more eloquent expressions, which is best evident during his passive-aggressive treatment of Homer Simpson (who at the time was undergoing the gradual symptoms of a quadruple heart attack) upon calling him to his office, where he berated Homer by saying ""Your indolence is inefficacious!"", which confused Homer enough for his heart to calm down slightly, only for Mr. Burns to angrily translate that as meaning that Homer's terrible at his job, which ultimately had Homer's stress level rise to catastrophic levels.
 He is out-of-touch with modern technology and behavior: he practices phrenology, writes with a quill pen, drives a 1936 Stutz Bearcat while wearing an Edwardian motorist outfit which includes a hat, trench coat, driving gloves and goggles, carries antiquated weapons for self-defense, such as a mace or a blunderbuss, and, when not chauffeured, drives without regard to traffic laws in the manner of early 20th century motorists. His driver's license expired in 1909 (he even is still in the possession of several useless items from the same era, such as a Ticket Stub from the silent film ""Tillie's Punctured Romance"" and his SS ID Card from his time as a Gestapo Officer). It is also implied that part of the reason he once managed to go bankrupt was because he failed to realize that most if not all of the blue chip companies (pertaining to transoceanic Zeppelins, spats, inflammable powders, and hay), as well as the Baltimore Opera Hat Company, either had long been defunct or otherwise never even gained traction by the present era.
 It has been shown throughout the series that Burns is, despite his somewhat dilapidated mindset, an incredibly intelligent businessman. In the list shown above, Burns can manage a number of commercial operations successfully, and is able to create big profits, which is a likely reason for Burns being so wealthy to begin with. He was able to convert Springfield's church into a successful advertising business, as well as incorporate an oil drilling company in a very short amount of time He is also a skilled business acquirer. His financial skills have come in handy for certain occasions where he loses his fortune, as when he lost his money due to bad investments (which was because of his outdated input), he was able to rebuild his wealth and empire by recycling, thanks to Lisa Simpson's help (he even offered her ten percent of his profits, but she declined). On a similar note, he was implied to have had a hand in the expansion of Ticketmaster via purchasing the company as a way to ""widen the gap between the rich and the poor.""
 Burns appears to be unaware of 20th century political and private developments, such as Fidel Castro becoming President of Cuba, Siam becoming Thailand, India gaining its independence from the British Empire, New Mexico becoming a state, women being granted independence rights, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 (with him also blaming Smithers for not warning him about the crash despite the fact that, as Smithers pointed out, the event in question occurred 25 years before he was even born and thus was in absolutely no position to warn him of the event), Idlewild Airport becoming JFK Airport, the extinction of the dodo, confusing The Ramones with The Rolling Stones, and the occurrence of the 1939 World's Fair. Despite serving in World War II, he was unaware (or had forgotten) that Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, prompting World War I. He also was shown to be unaware of more contemporary developments, such as the musicals ""Cats"" and ""The King and I"" (where he sarcastically suggested that Smithers try making musicals relating to the common housecat and the King of Siam regarding his learning that Smithers did a musical based on Malibu Stacy). Humorously, he has also asked a vending machine for taffy, thinking its like a candy shop.
 Mr. Burns' investment portfolio includes long-defunct shares in ""Confederated Slave Holdings, Trans-Atlantic Zeppelin, Amalgamated Spats, Congreve's Inflammable Powders, U.S. Hay"", and an ""up-and-coming Baltimore Opera Hat Company"".
 Burns commonly refers to deceased persons as if they were alive, including Al Jolson, Tallulah Bankhead, Louise Brooks, Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, and Mordecai ""Three Finger"" Brown.
 Burns used to pay his employees a salary less than a worker in the United States can normally earn (which is illegal), but the only employee Burns pays a normal salary is Smithers. This attitude entitles Burns to deduct his employees' wages as much as he likes, with Smithers being the only exception.
 He also believes that some social institutions and inventions are novel or nonexistent, such as the Packard automobile, the Fire Department, ice cream (or, as he calls it, ""iced cream""), vending machines, recycling, strip clubs, the Dumont, the word ""into"", silent films like the 1929 film Lulu(although he has seen other films in the past), and the synonymy of ketchup and catsup. While trying to chat up Gloria Jailbird, Burns offers to play the clavichord and show stereopticon images of the Crimean War.
 Mr. Burns' office Mr. Burns strangling Homer in a loving and kindly fashion Due to his vast wealth, Mr. Burns has access to the best health care anyone in Springfield could ever receive. He employs elaborate medical methods, such as frequently replacing his shins and pickling his brain in vinegar, all forcing his body to continue functioning long after its natural expiration date. Due to his unnaturally long life, Burns has numerous physical ailments and health problems, or more accurately, he has every physical ailment and health problem, including several discovered in him. He is often to the point where he seems to straddle the line between life and death. The Mayo Clinic diagnosed Burns with ""Three Stooges Syndrome"", where a delicate state of homeostasis is created by the presence in his body of every disease known to man cancel each other out. Mr. Burns took this as being invincible, although the doctor who told him this implied that the slightest breeze could kill him.
 Physically weak, he often has great difficulty performing the most basic physical tasks, such as giving a thumbs up, receiving a hug, crushing a paper cup, or stepping on an insect. He is weak enough to be pushed over by an ant or a high-five, or pushed down by a sponge scrub on his head (although he was able to eventually get up in the latter case). In addition, he was frail enough that even an ant was able to overpower him and knock him on his feet when he tried to stamp it. Oddly enough, he does not seem to be affected by the recoil caused by firing a gun, as seen when he fired a blunderbuss at one of his employees(although the latter did humorously survive). He has a hunched back and his vertebral column is visible when he is viewed from the side. His exposure to radiation during his lifetime of working at the plant has given his skin a healthy green glow and left him infertile and as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. A 1,000 dollar bill dispensed from an ATM bruised him, leaving a reverse imprint of the bill on his chest. When Burns was incarcerated at the Springfield Penitentiary, when he was getting a mugshot, the camera flash was able to slam him against a wall and knock him out.
 Burns was once mistaken for an alien after his weekly medical treatments His organs have grown immensely weak over the years: his heart is black and desiccated, it barely beats or does not beat at all, and is shrunken to the size of a cherry. Burns' blood type is double-O negative. When his finger is pricked, he bleeds dust, and when his arm is poked with a needle, it passes through his arm like meringue. A chunk of Burns' brain once fell out through his ear. One time, his lungs came out through his mouth and acted as an airbag. On another occasion, he indicated in an off-hand manner that he only has a single lung. If he is not careful, fluid can build up in his hands, causing them to swell to enormous proportions, and his fingers have been shown to flap in the breeze released from a bowling ball dispenser. It has been revealed that if Burns sweats even one drop, he could die of dehydration unless he takes a bath immediately. Burns had also lost body parts due to leprosy (one example is when he lost an entire fingernail in a cup). Both his legs have a crease in them, down the entire length. Even the mere act of forceful spitting in shock was enough to drain him of his body liquids to such an extent that he appeared severely wrinkled, thus requiring Smithers to spray him with moisturizer to instantly rejuvenate his face. Burns was once persuaded into giving Ralph Wiggum a piece of candy, but after he does, his skull collapses and he nearly dies. He then weakly steals the candy back and regains his health. Apparently, the only reason that he could survive was due to hate, and he could not give out his kindness without getting killed as a result.
 Although very much frail, he is not immune to the effects of weight gain from increased appetites, as after obviously being inspired by Homer's positive (at the time) food reviews for various food chains when he took up a side job of being a food critic, Mr. Burns became immensely overweight and while congratulating Homer on having gotten him to gain weight, he admits he never felt jollier before then. However, his weight gain still did not alleviate all of his health problems, as Mr. Burns when attempting to ""toe-hop"" as a gesture had his shin bones snap off, forcing him to waddle off, with his ruefully implying that this was not the first time such a thing happened (and presumably proceeded to incense him enough that he became part of the angry mob that tried to beat Homer up as retribution later on).
 Mr. Burns' medical treatment includes a weekly procedure that he goes through every Friday evening after work. First, his chiropractors perform a slight spinal adjustment. Then, a team of doctors administers eye drops in his eyes (which causes his pupils to dilate very huge), painkillers, and a painful vocal chord scraping (that is done by Dr. Nick); its purpose is to postpone his death for one week. This makes him become temporarily ""nice"". He also glows green, a result of working in a sub-standard nuclear plant for ages causing his body to accumulate tons of radiation. Burns' appearance once caused Homer to mistake him for an alien. He also had his brain flushed out with vinegar and his eyes ""re-balled"". Though Burns needs double O-negative blood, he stated (in the song) that he took blood from sheep. Burns' knees were also sent out to be repaired at a ""shop"". His dentures replace themselves.
 He once broke all his bones after falling from his office window and being crushed by his stuffed polar bear during a fight between Smithers and Homer. On rare occasions, he has displayed great strength and skill, such as when he managed to single-handily capture the Loch Ness Monster (though it was never explained how he did so or seen on-screen) and when he rescued his girlfriend, Gloria Jailbird, from a burning building (although she wound up carrying him out of the blaze).
 Burns is almost entirely work-oriented. At the nuclear plant, Burns spends most of time in his office, monitoring his employees via closed-circuit security cameras. In his office, he keeps a team of ten high-priced lawyers, a scale model of Springfield, a special microbe-resistant chamber, a two-seat escape pod, and the ""League of Evil"" - a sinister cabal whose members are long deceased, but whose skeletons remain. The booby traps in Burns' office include cricket poison, a secret trapdoor (though he sometimes forgets where it is and was once under renovation), a catapult that fires 100-gram weights, and a ceiling-mounted suction tube, which he can use to transport dissident workers to Morocco. He is also a loan officer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Employees’ Credit Union.
 Kent Brockman also credits Burns with having stolen Christmas from 1981 to 1985. He also claims to have participated in the Boston Tea Party.
 As evidenced by his role in the series, Burns has owned or co-owned a number of business ventures and companies in Springfield, including the Monty Burns Casino (later demolished), the Little Lisa Recycling Plant, the Burns Slant Drilling Co., Burns Media, the electric company, the water works and even a hotel on Baltic Avenue. He also operated the Burns Germ Warfare Laboratory (which was destroyed by Mona Simpson and a group of protesters).
 He owns the rights to the song, White Christmas, after blowing the chance to buy Picasso's painting Guernica, but the song ended up earning him billions; one of many possible results of his riches. Burns has used his power and wealth to blackmail and bribe various members of Springfield, including Mayor Quimby, as well as safety inspectors. He once attempted to block out the sun to force Springfield residents to increase their use of electricity produced by the nuclear plant and was subsequently shot by Maggie. The town is routinely subject to Burns' abuse, and there is a general dislike of him throughout the town. In The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run, during mission 4 in Level 7, it is implied that he had a business partner that he killed. When Homer goes to his office, Mr. Burns mistakes him for the ghost of his former partner.
 Burns' bedroom in Burns Manor Burns Manor He usually releases a whole lot of hounds towards guests (implied only to drive out the guests from the house and without the actual intention of hurting the guests). He has at least one 30+-year-old dog named Crippler, who specialized in attacking hippies, but is now so old he has trouble walking. If a guest put him in a particularly good mood, he will return the favor by significantly reducing the number of hounds released to one. At times, he has employed for protecting a force of Wizard of Oz - style monkey guards, a personal paramilitary force, a riot police squad, and a robotic Richard Simmons.
 The interior of the mansion includes a room containing a thousand monkeys at a thousand typewriters, a bottomless pit, a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors, a human chessboard, the largest television in the free world, a ""Hall of Patriots"" that commemorates his ancestors, a laboratory, a botanical garden of vultures bearing his likeness, a safe containing a Beefeater guard, a theater that is showing round-the-clock movies and shows which plays regardless whether there is an audience or not, a TV studio and a CCTV room. His residence also contains a closet full of clothes made from many different types of animals, such as a vest made from a gorilla's chest and loafers made from gophers.
 The mansion is also home to many rare historical artifacts including the only existing nude photo of Mark Twain, the suit that Charlie Chaplin was buried in, King Arthur's mythical sword Excalibur, and a rare first draft of the Constitution with the word ""suckers"" in it.
 Aside from his main residence, he also has a summer retreat, which ended up being squatted in by the Simpson family as part of a movie. He also owns a mansion on Lengthy Island.
 Burns and Gloria Burns has been engaged at least three times: A woman named Gertrude who died of loneliness and rabies, to Jacqueline Bouvier, and to a policewoman named Gloria Jailbird. Though when he tells Homer about Gertrude, he says that he was her fiancé, but he implies that they were married, as he says he missed their wedding, their honeymoon, and their divorce due to working so hard. He was once involved with a fellow student during his time at Yale University named Mimsy Bancroft, and then later had an affair with her daughter, Lily. He once had an affair with Countess von Zeppelin, as he slept with her one time. He also once in love with Marge, and pursued a relationship with her, but stopped once he discovered that Marge was married. Agnes Skinner revealed that she once had an affair with Mr. Burns during the Great Depression (""let him feel me up""). Burns once caught the attention of Selma when she discovers that Burns is single.
 Charles Montgomery Burns was born to Clifford Burns and Daphne Burns (before the marriage, her maiden name was Daphne Charles (hence Mr. Burns' first name Charles)).
 Mr. Burns' great-great-grandmother's sister-in-law's brother's fourth great-grandson is Homer Simpson.
 Another line to Trixie Simpson goes like this:
 If we carry on, we find out that Homer is also Burns' grandmother's sister-in-law (who is also her second cousin)'s grandmother's brother's fourth great-grandson.
 Also, Mr. Burns and Homer are actually related by marriage (which makes Bart being Burns' heir extremely ironic, because Bart would be related to him).
 Burns family tree Mr. Burns had a strained relationship with his own mother, whom he apparently tried to kill at least once, for having had an affair with President Taft. When he was asked the cause of his parents' deaths, he replied: ""Got in my way"".
 Mr. Burns is served a three-eyed fish while running for governor Mr. Burns is a member of various organizations. In his early years, while he was a college student at Yale University, he was a member of the Skull and Bones society. During World War II, Burns became a member of the Flying Hellfish squad, a group of soldiers who entered into a tontine regarding the ownership of German artwork. Burns was a member of the Stonecutters until it disbanded, at which time he joined the secret society that succeeded it: The Ancient Mystic Society of No Homers (One source of dislike of Burns for the ""Stonecutters"" is that despite his wealth and greed, he is outranked by Lenny). He is currently the head of the Springfield Republican Party and once headed a short-lived religion. He is also a member of the ""Excludes Club"", the Springfield Golf and Country Club, and the National Rifle Association. He holds a chair (a demonic throne with snarling dogs chained to it) at Springfield University and controls an anti-democratic paramilitary force in Latin America.
 Burns attended the annual Billionaire's Retreat, where he won the Austin Celtics basketball team from The Rich Texan in a poker game. After severely mismanaging the team, he lost nearly half his net worth. At the following year's retreat, it was discovered he was no longer a billionaire. He was ejected from the camp, and thrown over a wall into the slack-jawed millionaire's camp.
 Burns tried to run for Governor until Marge ruined his chances by serving a three-eyed fish (an example of the adverse effects of the nuclear plant) for dinner in front of the media. In the end, he echoes Charles Foster Kane by crying out his name in rage and vows for the rest of his life to make Homer Simpson's life miserable.
 Burns was a Freemason ""before it was trendy"".
 In the Simpsons Comics 69 story, ""In Burn$ We Tru$t"", he takes over the First Church of Springfield, which he uses in order to help spread his influence, with him stating that it is a sin for all environmental organizations, including the Environmental Protection Agency, Green Peace, and ""Lisa Simpson's Tree Hugging Society"". It is later revealed that he plans to ascend to the position of Pope, so that he can have tax-free access to all of the Vatican gold. However, when he learns that the church is not Catholic, he promptly quits (much to everyone's glee), but only on the condition that Reverend Lovejoy will grant him permission to Heaven when he dies. Eventually, he agrees, but it is comically revealed that Mr. Burns can only go to Dog Heaven when he dies. Later, it is shown in Dog Heaven (a.k.a. Cat Hell) that Mr. Burns is running around, pretending to be a dog, hoping to ""rise up the alpha dog ladder!""
 He is shot and killed by Kostas Becker alongside Disco Stu, Fat Tony, Legs, Louie, and Johnny Tightlips.
 Mr. Burns in the future In one possible future, eight years from the present, he was a shut-in who sponsored a Yale scholarship as punishment for stealing Christmas. He kept diamonds to have them changed into Earth's most precious mineral of the age: coal. His home was also guarded by a large group of flying unicorn-clam creatures (uni-clams).
 In one possible future, 15 years from the present, Mr. Burns was cryogenically frozen. Scientists worked to find a cure for 17 stab wounds to the back so that he could be thawed out and cured. He was cured in time to attend Lisa Simpson's wedding. However, he was not completely thawed, as when he tried to sit down, he snapped in half, which was also cured.
 In one possible future, in 1,000,000 AD, Burns was alive as a cyborg. He once again found Bobo after leaving him behind roughly every century.
 Mr. Burns appears in The Simpsons: Bart &amp; the Beanstalk as two characters. He first appears as ""Monty the Miser"", who provides Bart with both magic beans and a slingshot in exchange for the cow (the latter mostly because Bart refused the magic beans), thus having him set the plot forward. He later appears as the boss of the second level, as a cloud in Mr. Burns' likeness.
 Count Burns Count Burns is a vampire. Lisa says that she is suspicious about him, but no one believes her. She and Bart find Mr. Burns' secret lair, which can be accessed by a staircase that has a lever which doubles as a fun slide, and Bart (while fleeing from a horde of vampires) says, ""I know I really shouldn't, but when am I gonna be here again?"" before pulling the lever. Unfortunately for him, the horde of vampires are waiting at the bottom of the slide, and Count Burns bites Bart's neck, causing him to turn into a vampire. The Simpsons are then worried that Bart could get worse and they have to kill the head vampire, who is Count Burns. Homer kills Count Burns (who, after getting stabbed in a heart and freaking out, comes back to life to fire Homer, then dies again) but it is revealed that Marge is the head vampire. Just as the vampire versions of Homer, Marge, Bart, Maggie and Grampa are about to bite Lisa, they all say, ""Happy Halloween, everyone!"" before they all parody the ending scene to A Charlie Brown Christmas.
 Lord Montymort Mr. Burns is also Lord Montymort, who is based on Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter book and film series. He captures young wizards and witches to takes their powers away.
 Mr. Burns acts as the main antagonist of this game. He rigs the election results of an art competition on The Krusty the Clown Show to have Bart win, as part of his diabolical plan to have his relatives kill off the Simpsons (though he admits he wasn't happy with going through with rigging it due to how Bart's artwork was exceptionally poor). His motive for doing so is implied to be the result of the family being a significant drain on his finances, as when discussing the plot with Smithers, a stock chart titled ""profits"" with a decreasing line can be seen in the background. However, the Simpsons proceed to outsmart every single one of his relatives Fu Manchu Burns, Abominable Snow Burns, Ramses Burns, and Eric Von Burns in China, the North Pole, Egypt, and Hollywood with Mr. Burns, after cutting off ties to his relatives as a punishment for their failure, ultimately being forced to swallow his pride and appear on The Krusty the Clown Show to personally congratulate Bart, with Bart proceeding to throw a pie in his face.
 Mr. Burns appears as the final boss of this game, operating a giant mechanical robot from within that changes form depending on the damage it receives from the Simpson family. He also was the one who orchestrated Smithers' theft of a diamond, which also indirectly made him responsible for Maggie's kidnapping as well, as Smithers ended up kidnapping Maggie due to the diamond that he stole was knocked towards Maggie after Smithers bumped into Homer and she started using it as a pacifier. After being defeated, Mr. Burns is knocked out unconscious and Maggie then places her pacifier into Mr. Burns' mouth.
 Mr. Burns appears as a playable character in the game. If the player wins a full game with him, the ending shows him trying to move the trophy, although due to his obvious lack of physical strength, he could barely move it an inch before falling down in exhaustion. Maggie then emerges from the trophy and offers Mr. Burns a lollipop, causing Mr. Burns to beg for mercy before Maggie throws it at his head, knocking him out. His reaction to Maggie's offer references the events of ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"". He also appears in Apu's ending, where he forces Apu to give him the latter's trophy at gunpoint and makes his escape.
 Mr. Burns buys out the Springfield Transit System and turns them into nuclear buses. Springfield, in order to buy it back from him, then proceeds to create a for-hire taxi service to raise up enough money to do so, namely $1,000,000. In one of the missions, it is also said that he buys out the Springfield Shopper. Also, if the player drives in the Springfield Mountains, it can drive into Burns Manor. In the last mission, the player has to battle Mr. Burns as Homer, where Homer has to smash the statues in Burns' garden. Also, in the second mission, the player needs to dodge him.
 In every single road rage or Sunday drive, he tries to hit the player with his car. However, if the player uses a cheat code, the player can drive his car, a nuclear bus, and even Mr. Burns driving a brick. In the downtown location, his bus depot can be seen. One of the other locations is his nuclear power plant.
 Upon collecting $1,000,000, what happens depends on the version of the game. In the GameCube/Xbox/PS2 versions, Mr. Burns, while making clear that he is fed up with the people of Springfield complaining about his nuclear-powered buses and saying that it outranked even the 1967 Summer of Love in terms of the most contemptible effort of civil disobedience, caves and lets them have their public transport system back, but then ominously warns the player that they have not seen the last of him before sending the player down his trap door. In the GBA version, he simply expresses shock alongside Smithers when Homer arrives with a crane to drop the $1,000,000 to pay back the transit system.
 Mr. Burns appears as a boss, but cannot be fought directly. He accompanies Smithers while he is on the ring, throwing explosive test tubes at the player. Unlike most enemy characters, Smithers and Mr. Burns are not unlockable.
 Mr. Burns is seen telling Homer where Plopper went.
 The player can drive to the nuclear power plant at the first level, and Mr. Burns tells everyone bluntly to leave the plant. In addition, Homer investigates Mr. Burns due to suspecting the latter to be potentially being responsible for mysterious black vans popping up over town and spying on people (Homer in particular), with Mr. Burns citing innocence (although he does admit to having arranged to have Amelia Airhart's plane shot down due to being ""too big for her jumpers""), and then proceeding to release the hounds on Homer and also requesting that Smithers fire Homer if he did work at the plant.
 In the last level, the player can climb up to Mr. Burns' office. The player also sees him in Level 7, where he provides the player with a map containing all of the nuclear waste barrels he buried all over Springfield (although due to Homer saying ""aliens"", Mr. Burns initially thought he was going to use them to kill off illegal immigrants until Homer clarified that he meant ""tentacle aliens"") and can eventually drive his car if the player completes the bonus mission in Level 7. He also implies in this level that he had murdered Merriweather, his old business partner and had been haunted by him, since he's initially mistaken Homer for his ghost and lets slip his murder of him and causing him to express awkwardness when learning Homer is not his ghost.
 In Lisa the Tree Hugger, the player stops Mr. Burns from destroying the ecosystem. Burns plans to cut down every tree in Springfield and turn each one into a single luxury toothpick. When the logging facility is destroyed, Mr. Burns has Smithers' phone in some goons to rough up Al Gore to make himself feel better. Later, in Medal of Homer, a younger Mr. Burns steals paintings from Ville de St. Capitulons and protects them on board his personal naval carrier with a squad of sailors that resemble Smithers. The younger Mr. Burns reappears in the Game Over level, when he tells Orc-Moe to hold on, but leaves him behind when he steals the paintings again.
 Mr. Burns' Unlock Screen Mr. Burns is one of the characters of the game, and can be unlocked when the player's Springfield is at Level 11 and upon completion of the power plant cooling towers.
 Mr. Burns' appearance in ""Homer's Odyssey"" Burns' character, appearance, and mannerisms are based on several different people. The show's creator, Matt Groening, principally based Burns on Fredrik Olsen, a reclusive Norwegian shipping magnate and the owner of Timex. Drawing further inspiration from oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, and fictional character Henry Potter from It's a Wonderful Life, Groening made Burns the ""embodiment of corporate greed"". Animator David Silverman based Burns' appearance on Fox founder Barry Diller, and modeled his body on a praying mantis. The idea of Burns reading employee names off of cards in ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"" came from an article about Ronald Reagan that writer Al Jean had read. In some episodes, parallels have been drawn between Burns and moguls such as Howard Hughes and, more frequently, fictional character Charles Foster Kane from Citizen Kane. Writer George Meyer lifted Burns' ""Excellent!"" hand gesture from his former Saturday Night Live partner Jim Downey.
 Matt Groening got Burns' middle name from a Montgomery Ward department store in Portland, Oregon's Northwest Industrial district, and his surname from Burnside Street, the main thoroughfare in Portland. Burns' first name being Charles is a reference to Charles Foster Kane. In the script for ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"", Al Jean and Mike Reiss refer to him as ""Mr. Meanie"".
 In Season 2, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns' relationship, and they often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition.
 Mr. Burns was originally voiced by actor Christopher Collins in the episodes ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,"" ""Homer's Odyssey,"" ""There's No Disgrace Like Home,"" and ""The Telltale Head"". He was soon replaced by Harry Shearer because Sam Simon found Collins ""difficult to work with."" Additionally, Christopher Collins died on June 12, 1994. Shearer has voiced the character ever since. He modeled the voice on Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Shearer is also the voice of Smithers and is able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Shearer said that Mr. Burns is the most difficult character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice. He describes Mr. Burns as his favorite character, saying he ""like Mr. Burns because he is pure evil. A lot of evil people make the mistake of diluting it. Never adulterate your evil.""
 In 2014, Shearer won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance on ""Four Regrettings and a Funeral"" for voicing Mr. Burns.

 Un-dead werewolf Flanders Ned homeless Maude died in the episode ""Alone Again, Natura-Diddily"" 
 Nedward ""Ned"" Flanders, Jr., more commonly known as just Flanders, is the Simpson family's extremely religious next door neighbor. He is a genuinely well-meaning, good-natured person. Though firmly religious, he can be timid and something of an easy pushover. He is a major character in The Simpsons and a minor, recurring antagonist in the Treehouse of Horror episodes. Ned thoroughly worships God and strictly follows the Bible as literally as possible and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. He also owns the Leftorium and a home business, Flancrest Enterprises, which makes religious hook rugs. He also works as a member of the Springfield Volunteer Fire Department. He even (legally) owns the Simpsons' house, renting it out to the family at a low rate, showing that he would burn through much of his resources just to help his neighbors out. In Hurricane Neddy, Flanders was shown to be a kid 30 years ago in the show's floating timeline, but in Viva Ned Flanders, he claims to be 60 years old and looks younger thanks to following the 3 C's. Some fans believe he lied about being 60 in order to get a senior citizen's discount.
 Ned being spanked as part of his treatment Ned as a boy with his parents Ned Flanders grew up in New York and was the son of ""Freaky Beatniks"" who did not discipline Ned and let him run wild. Eventually, they took him to Dr. Foster, a psychiatrist, who put the young Ned through the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol, which involved eight months of continuous spanking. The treatment worked so well that it rendered Ned unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsensical jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper, causing Ned to unknowingly repress his anger. Flanders got his diploma from Oral Roberts University. Flanders worked as a salesman in the pharmaceutical industry for the bulk of his adult life. Having saved much of his earnings, Flanders decided to quit his job and invested his family's life savings into a store in the Springfield mall called ""The Leftorium"" specializing in products for left-handed people. He lives at 744 Evergreen Terrace.
 He attended an all-boys school, where he played Blanche DuBois in a production of A Streetcar Named Desire.
 Ned's age is uncertain. In ""Hurricane Neddy"" he is shown as a child in a flashback 30 years earlier, but later, in ""Viva Ned Flanders"", he states that he is 60 years old. (He attributes his youthful appearance to ""clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of vitamin church."") Later still, in ""Walking Big &amp; Tall"", he is once again shown as a child 30 years ago. In the latter appearance, he is shown to be around the same age as Homer and Marge, who are in the same scene as children.
 Ned is very honest, kind and sincere in carrying out the Christian doctrines of charity, kindness and compassion to an extent unseen within the rest of the Springfield community. He is frequently shown doing volunteer work, and is rigorously honest and upright, even going so far as to spend an entire day tracking down a Leftorium customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over. He once donated a kidney and a lung out of the goodness of his heart to whoever needs them first. He is also a good neighbour to the Simpsons, regularly offering his assistance. Ned’s dogged friendship inspires the loyalty of others; when his Leftorium appeared on the verge of bankruptcy shortly after it opened, Homer arranged a George Bailey-esque bailout with the help of many people in Springfield. Upon discovering that Bart and Lisa Simpson were not baptized he immediately took it upon himself to (unsuccessfully) conduct the ceremony without their parents' consent. He also was one of the organizers of a mob to remove the La Maison Derrière due to the amoral exploitation of the sexual desires in males (although he notably had to ask for permission to commence a mob to Belle, the owner of the place they were attempting to tear down in a mob frenzy, indicating that he either wasn't completely aware of how a mob was supposed to work or was unwilling to go to the extreme of inciting a mob riot to get rid of the house). In more recent episodes he seems to have gained more tolerance to other religions and homosexuality, as long as the people in question are good-natured. However, his bias and perspective still make him think that they will have a harder time getting to heaven.
 Ned's house on Evergreen Terrace. 
Ned was married to the equally religious Maude Flanders (after whose death he married Edna Krabappel). Ned and Maude had two children together: the sheltered and naïve Rod and Todd. While still married to Maude, Ned married Ginger, a waitress, while on a drunken bender in Las Vegas. Ginger came to live with Ned and his sons for a brief period following Maude's death, but she quickly grew tired of the Ned's sickly-sweet personalities and fled. Flanders has also been connected romantically with a beautiful Christian-rock singer, Rachel Jordan, and Tiffany Sloane, a movie star. He also makes absolute certain every year to pay and file his tax returns at the start of the new year, especially when considering how the vast majority of Springfield usually waited until April 15 to file their tax returns. Canadian version of Ned Homer generally loathes Ned, because his family, job, health and self-discipline are of higher quality than he could ever hope to attain himself. Ned is also very bossy with his beliefs, which Homer hates. Homer has since come to have a love-hate relationship with Ned, sometimes being his best friend, partly due to Ned's selfless tolerance of him, and other times treating Ned with complete disregard. Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing. Nowadays Homer seems to regard Ned as more of a nuisance. Sometimes, Marge considers Ned to be a perfect neighbor and usually sides with him instead of her husband, which always enrages Homer. When Marge lends her voice on these matters they usually end with Homer angrily calling her ""The President of The I Love Ned Flanders Fan Club"" or with Homer furiously and sarcastically admitting that Ned is ""perfect in every way"" and that he himself is not perfect like Ned Flanders.
 Ned is not without facing life's challenges, but has been shown to frequently call Reverend Lovejoy for advice often, even over minuscule and petty things (""I... I think I'm coveting my own wife!""), to the point that Lovejoy has stopped caring and has even suggested that Flanders try a different religion. Reverend Lovejoy used to care for Ned's problems, but over the years Lovejoy became increasingly uninterested and annoyed when he would constantly turn to him for help, and even to frustration, as many of their talks have led his enjoyment of life's simple pleasures to go spoiled awry, and even to acts of passive-aggressive vengeance, in one instance of himself encouraging his Old English Sheepdog to defecate on Ned's lawn in return for many instances of the former. Ned is shown to have a room in his house filled with memorabilia of the Beatles. He claims that this is because they were ""bigger than Jesus"". He also even owns a small home business called Flancrest Enterprises. In addition, his modesty was such that he even goes as far as to bathe in swimming trunks specifically to avoid having to avoid anyone, even himself, see his privates, as he admits when Marge and Homer have him babysit Maggie once when they talk to him as he's bathing.
 Ned is also against drugs. When Ned, Homer and Apu go on road trip to Canada for cheap prescription drugs, they meet a man who looks and acts just like Ned, the man then offers Ned marijuana (""Hey, would you like to puff on a reeferino? It's legal here."") but he promptly turns down (""They warned me Satan would be attractive. Let's go""). He did, however, briefly smoke a cigarette when playing the role of Mad Dog during his fire safety skit with some disgust. He also once suffered hallucinogenic experiences of the Dancing Bears and Skeletons of the Grateful Dead crossing the road, as well as witnessing an entity resembling a fusion between the hammers from Pink Floyd's The Wall and the Rolling Stones' lips &amp; tongue attempting to kiss him after drinking groovy grove juice that unknown to him, was spiked with Peyote thanks to Homer Simpson.
 His sons Rod and Todd are very sheltered and raised in an extremely strict climate of Christian morality, causing them to be unable to behave like all the other children in Springfield (""They're going to be eaten alive, in Middle School"" Lisa once observed). For  instance, the family has at least five different Trivial Pursuit sets relating to different versions of the Bible. ""He is a real Christian. He stinks!"" said Homer. Also, all of the family's board games contain no dice, as Ned believes that dice are ""wicked"". Rod says that they just move one space at a time, as it is ""less fun that way"". His pet peeve was Maude underlining passages in his Bible.
 Ned without mustache Because of his childhood and the therapy he was given, he learned to repress his anger by a significant amount, which also resulted in the creation of his odd choice of words. However, his anger eventually was unable to be suppressed anymore after his house, which was demolished by a hurricane despite several protective efforts such as placing a tarp over the house, and the house being rebuilt in a very shoddy fashion and eventually collapsing, at which point he lashed out at his friends and neighbors, even shocking and appalling Bart when he, in his anger, lashed out at Bart attempting to defend Marge from his anger and hinted that Bart will end up a street beggar when he grows up.
 However, in some early episodes Ned is occasionally shown when he's angry. The first episode to ever show Ned's rage was the episode ""Dead Putting Society"". The episode starts-off with Ned inviting Homer in for a beer after an unsuccessful attempt at mowing the lawn. While visiting with Ned, Homer sees that Ned has a much better lifestyle than he does and gets into a fight with Ned. Homer leaves Ned's house in a very mad manner. Eventually the episode boils up to the point of Homer and Ned both losing their tempers and making a bet and entering their sons in a mini-golf tournament. The bet said that ""The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow his neighbor's lawn in his wife's best Sunday dress"". The episode ends with both fathers having to wear the dresses as both Bart and Todd decide that they are equally good. The next episode to showcase Ned's wrath was ""Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment"" were at the start of the episode Ned is seen and loudly heard throwing a man out of his home for trying to sell him stolen cable. Ned even threatens to box the guys ears in which results in the man becoming terrified of Ned. The third early instance of Ned's rage was the episode ""Homer Loves Flanders"" where it begins with Ned and Homer going to a football game and enjoying each other's company. Homer and Ned then become really good friends, but it soon becomes apparent that Homer is obsessed with Ned and his family. Both Homer's obsession and extreme stupidity drive Ned into hating Homer and finally becoming so annoyed with him that Ned's rage causes him to snap very loudly at Homer. The fourth and last early reference came in ""Bart The Lover"" where Todd picks-up on Homer's potty-mouthed language and Todd says, ""I don't want any of your damn vegetables,"" at the dinner table. Todd's newly discovered bad word sets-off Ned's temper and Todd gets punished by Ned right away for saying the nasty word. While trying to discover where Todd learned the nasty word he hears Homer swearing angrily and asks him to try and cut back on his ""foul lingo"" which ends with Homer having a talk with Marge and him actually trying to be a good neighbor by reducing his swearing.
 In the eighth season of the show, the issue of why Ned very seldom ever shows his anger was greatly explored in the episode ""Hurricane Neddy"". In the episode, a very powerful hurricane hits Springfield and among the buildings that are destroyed is Ned's house. Ned's neighbors and friends all try to rebuild his home (led by Homer), but fail miserably. The sudden destruction of his home and the horribly failed attempt to rebuild it are what finally drives Ned to really lose it. He snaps at almost everyone in Springfield and goes on a long, mean, spiteful, and extremely loud rant about how horrible and annoying he thinks that everyone in Springfield is and why he thinks so. Homer is the last person that Ned comes to and when he does, instead of shouting at Homer like how he did to everyone else, Ned just in a calm voice tells Homer that he's the worst person that he has ever met. Homer, however due to his low IQ is not offended or even hurt by the remark. After the long, tiresome rant, Ned sees that he really needs help and drives himself to The Calmwood Mental Hospital. The episode ends with Ned's former childhood doctor, Doctor Foster, coming to see him and explain that as a child Ned was an uncontrollable hellion due to his parents being beatniks who never punished him when he was bad. Seeking help for their son's destructive behavior, they had Doctor Foster distribute a treatment known as the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol. The treatment was a non-stop eight-month spanking technique that was supposed to stop a child's bad behavior permanently. However, according to Doctor Foster, the treatment later proved to have worked too well and in many cases, it caused severe repressed anger management issues in mid to late adulthood. To administer an outlet for this repressed rage, Doctor Foster has Ned think of somebody who really annoys him. At first, Ned can't come up with anybody, so the doctor tries a list of names of the town residents. Most of which Ned happily responds to. That is until they come to Homer. Homer is then brought in as a way to get Ned to admit that he does not always like everyone he meets. At first, the treatment doesn't seem to work until Homer tells Ned that he's too happy a person and always likes everyone. Ned gets really angry and says that it isn't true because he hates the people who work at the post office due to them being so slow and having to wait in long lines, he loathes beatniks and hates his parents who are beatniks. Ned is then cured and he learns that when he's seething with rage then he should let the others know.
 In recent seasons following after Maude's death, Ned's demeanor has grown somewhat stern and hostile as opposed to his original jolly neighbor demeanor shown in earlier seasons. Some occasions to support this include mainly revolve around his ""Flanderization"" where he has become so Christianity-obsessed, that he would belittle other religions. One example would be in ""The Monkey Suit"", where Ned's fundamentalist intentions in enforcing creationism became so overzealous that it got Lisa thrown in jail when she went against it by teaching the theory of evolution in secrecy, after it was outlawed. In a lampshade to that episode in ""Judge Me Tender"", Ned deliberately stopped a fish from walking on land when it grew feet. Homer even goes to the point of saying, ""You used to be nicer"".
 Despite his attempts at being a good Christian, as well as a good neighbor, most of his good deeds nevertheless end up exploited by the various Springfielders, and are often mocked by the townspeople behind his back for his naivety, zealousness, strict beliefs, and intolerance. This ultimately reached its breaking point when, after allowing two female college students to rent one of the rooms of his house for studying, they took advantage of his trusting nature and filmed a soft-core webcam site called ""sexyslumberparty.com"" without his knowledge. As soon as he learned of this from Homer, he angrily evicted them from his house, although the damage was already done when, thanks to Homer leaking the videos to the entire town, the townspeople arrive at his house around the time he evicted them to cheer on the girls, causing him to realize that the entire town actually mocked him behind his back, and he was even more shocked when he learned that Homer was the one who leaked the videos. He then entered a very deep depression due to this, and decided to have his family move temporarily to Humbleton, Pennsylvania where the Humbleton figurines that he collected were being made, and also posting a note stating that he left town.
 How Flanders was once pictured by Marge when she was writing a book Despite a meek outward appearance, Ned hides an exceptionally well-built physique under his pink shirt and green sweater combination. When he is revealed to be 60, Ned claims his deceptively youthful appearance is due to his conformity to the ""three Cs"" - ""clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of vitamin Church"". According to many of the Springfield women, he is very handsome.
 Both Ned and his family rarely refer to his mustache as such, preferring nicknames such as ""Nose Neighbor,"" ""Mr. Tickles,"" ""The Soup Strainer,"" ""The Cookie Duster,"" ""The Pushbroom,"" and ""Dr. Fuzzenstein."" He once shaved it off, after Homer implied that people were mocking Ned's facial hair behind his back. He also once had it pulled off with a vacuum cleaner by Maude after Homer, who was thought to have leprosy, kissed Ned in gratitude for sending them to be treated. Ned's mustache would also affect his decision to move to the Humbleton, PA. After being hired at the town's Humble figurine manufacturing factory, Ned was ordered to shave his mustache, due to an unofficial ban on facial hair. Ned defiantly refused to shave his mustache for which he was labeled as a troublemaker. Interestingly, in one of the earliest references to Ned's facial hair, he shaved off his mustache without concern after Homer commented he should, and to strike a deal with Homer to please control his use of vulgarity as that was a bad influence on Todd. Homer is once again annoyed when he later sees a clean-shaven Flanders commenting that everyone likes his new appearance and he got the chance to star in a TV commercial.
 Ned is a devout Christian. Ned's sons have been raised in a strict climate of Christian morality, to which they willingly conform. It is revealed that they ""don't believe in flu shots"", much as their father considers insurance to be a ""form of gambling"" and dice games to be ""wicked."" Rod and Todd go to bed several hours before sunset and are not allowed to consume sugar, (which is ironic because in the movie he gives them hot chocolate. Which you see through the window and then he makes one for Bart). But this could be to the fact only Maude imposed the no-sugar rule. Since her death, it is possible Ned has not seen an issue with sugar.
 Devil Ned as he was shown in news Most of the entertainment enjoyed by the family involves religion in some way. The family uses at least five different versions of the Bible to play ""Bombardment...of Bible Questions!"" (""The bridal feast of Beth Chadruharazzeb!?""), and are part of a competitive bowling team called the Holy Rollers (their uniform consisting of a Franciscan Friar's robes). Ned seems to sense that he cannot completely shield his family from the vagaries of popular culture, but does his best to mitigate the effects; one of his children's stories concludes ""...and Harry Potter and all his wizard friends went straight to Hell for practicing witchcraft."" Though they have satellite TV, nearly all of the 230 channels are blocked out — likely for the best, as one episode of Itchy &amp; Scratchy was enough to more or less permanently scar Rod and Todd. Rod used to watch ""Davey and Goliath"", but finding the idea of talking dogs to be ""blasphemous"", he has since stopped.
 Ned is willing to fight for what he believes in. For example, he once attempted to forcibly baptize the Simpson children, using his portable baptism kit, after finding out that they had never undergone the ritual. Ned once reminded himself to get his hand ""re-blessed"" after shaking a Catholic priest's hand (odd, considering he keeps a Latin Vulgate Bible in his home).
 Despite occasional antipathy toward Catholicism, Judaism and Hinduism (he once compared worshiping Shiva to asking for help from Hawkman, and he fears that his children will grow up to become Jewish Hollywood producers), Ned is honest and sincere in carrying out the Christian doctrines of charity, kindness and compassion. He even admits (after a hurricane destroyed his home) that he has kept kosher just in case. He is frequently shown doing volunteer work, and is rigorously honest and upright, even going so far as to spend an entire day tracking down a Leftorium customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over (à la Abraham Lincoln). Similarly, after winning football tickets by answering a radio trivia question, he immediately asked for the cash value so he could report it on his income taxes. He also is a good neighbor to the Simpsons, regularly offering his assistance — and then suffering the consequences often paid to those with misguided and shortsighted good intentions.
 Ned with his family The Flanders Clan has members around the globe, who convened at the Flanders Family Reunion bible bashing BBQ. Relatives included Mexican José Flanders (""Buenos ding-dong-diddly días, señor"") and English Lord Thistlewick Flanders (""Charmed...  ...a-googily-doogily"").
 There was a relative of Flanders who served in World War II. He was a superior to Sgt. Abe Simpson. Abe called him Commander Flanders when yelling at Burns for stealing paintings.
 Flanders is believed to have 3 younger sisters. Ned and family planned on moving in with one of them who lived in Capital City after the loss of their home and business in Springfield. He might also have a possible unnamed brother or stepbrother.
 Ned has the odd habit of attaching ""diddly,"" ""doodly"" and other nonsensical phrases to his sentences. ""Hi-diddly-ho, neighborino,"" is a common example. This is the result of sublimated anger caused by his upbringing, anger which has no other outlet. This trait is, strangely, demonstrated by his relatives from around the world. However, one of his relatives; Lord Thistlewick Flanders, does not have this trait other than when pressured by Ned Flanders, which may imply that his relatives might just attach the trait when with Flanders. He also has the habit of saying ""Okally-Dokally"", when replying to someone - meaning OK. He might also occasionally add a ""doo"" on the end, for example... ""Okally Dokally-Doo"". This is more often than not repeated, when Homer tells him to ""Shut up"" or ""Get lost and we don't need your help"". He said ""Son of a diddly!"" in the episode Trilogy of Error.
 His extreme prudishness makes him averse to saying ""sex"" aloud, even when there are no children in sight — he either spells it out or sheepishly calls it ""doodily"". Ned also uses the word ""doodle"", ""Flander-doodle"" or ""shrinky-dink"" when referring to his penis (ironically, he actually shouts ""penis"" while praying with his kids before eating at Krusty Burger after Bart lands on a window naked in front of him). He wears a bathing suit in the shower or when he takes a bath. He also uses annotated words, when referring to words that could slightly have a bad, injury related, or slightly offensive meaning. An example is when Bart and Homer are on the roof, and Bart is dangling from the guttering. He says the word ""parapleig-orino"" referring to parapleigic (a person paralyzed from the waist down). Nevertheless, Bart and Homer join a gay pride parade. Then they both reply ""Shut up, Flanders..."" His speech pattern once got him into trouble with Rex Banner, because the latter thought he was drunk during a time when prohibition was revived.
 Ned's store, the Leftorium Ned worked as a salesperson in the pharmaceuticals industry for the bulk of his adult life. Having saved much of his earnings, Flanders announced during a barbecue he was throwing for his family and friends that he had quit his job and planned to invest the family's life savings into a new business. After burning his necktie, he proclaimed his intent to open a store in the Springfield Mall called The Leftorium, specializing in products for left-handed people including everything from left-handed can openers to an entirely left-handed car, of which only three were ever made. Many of the Leftorium's products are merely labeled as ""left-handed,"" such as pens and nunchucks. He does not sell, however, left-handed eyelash curlers.
 The Leftorium faces stiff competition from Leftopolis and Left-Mart. However, an unusually large proportion of Springfield's citizens are left-handed, including Bart Simpson, Mr. Burns, and Moe Szyslak.
 Ned began an Internet company called Flancrest Enterprises (which deals in religious hook-rugs) and founded a Bible-themed amusement park called Praiseland, in honor of his late wife (that he would go to such lengths to fulfill her last wish is unsurprising, as Ned had previously exerted himself a great deal in order to avoid disappointing Maude — after accidentally killing Maude's prized ficus plant, he attempted to bury and secretly replace it rather than explain the situation). Ned also spent a stint as principal of Springfield Elementary School, replacing Seymour Skinner (Armin Tamzarian).
 He, along with his late wife, also worked as a member of the Springfield Volunteer Fire Department, once saving Homer from his burning house. Because of his membership status, he also participates in Fire Safety Day at Springfield Elementary School, once doing an act trying to display the dangers of not taking care of Fire Safety where he acted completely different from himself for the role. He portrayed a pot-smoking, chain-smoking, hog-riding hippie party-goer named MadDog whom, after arriving back home with his girlfriend (played by Maude Flanders), who is also a pot-smoking hippie party-goer, they smoked a cigarette to ""make the night complete."" His girlfriend suggests that they get another smoke alarm in case their current one ""tricks out on them"" but MadDog refused as one was good enough for him before telling her that they should ""hit the sack."" While sleeping, MadDog accidentally drops his cigarette on his pants thus burning them. His girlfriend tries to warn him to stop, drop and roll, but he ignores it as he felt it was for clydes and that ""a little fire won't hurt him."" The performance turned out awry because Ned Flanders was forced to break character due to the fire spreading fast, and the usual method of stop drop and roll was not successful at all in putting out the fire, and had it not been for Bart Simpson's latest hijinx involving a hose and the gymnasium, he would have been burned alive.
 Ned had a relationship with Sara Sloane for the craic. They later broke up and she married Bob Ballaban.
 Flanders personality makes him think of Homer as good and friendly, but although they are friends, Homer doesn't like Flanders that much even at times has envied Flanders for having a better lifestyle than him for example before Maude's death homer openly made flirtatious comments about Maude in front of Marge and that in The first three seasons that were focused on how Ned was doing well financially since he was a devout Christian, how his family are well behaved, and how they are more respected than the Simpsons whilst Homer was angry with that on account of the Simpsons being a struggling family, constantly getting in trouble with the law and are mocked by the public of Springfield. The financial issue was largely resolved in When Flanders Failed. Homer has often borrowed many of Ned's possessions, none of which he ever had any intention of returning in the first place. Homer tells Ned to ""shut his stupid face"" on a regular basis, and has even prayed for his ruin and death — ""I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another, until you just wish Flanders was dead."" Ironically, at one time, Homer becomes Flanders' best friend, but becomes so annoying that Flanders starts to hate him, but eventually things go back to the way they were with no explanation as to why. Homer and Ned's relationship has been good on occasions, in which Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing (and often acting on) feelings of loathing and envy. Examples of this include Homer comforting Ned following Maude's death (seconds after preparing to bash Ned's head in with a rock) largely due to Marge's insistence that the Simpson family must now be supportive of the Flanders family in wake of the tragic loss of Maude, and helping Ned build Praiseland Amusement Park. Despite their friendship, Homer wrote the song ""Everybody Hates Ned Flanders,"" and even sang and produced it with David Byrnes. When Ned was embarrassed in front of the entire community after two young women who rented his house were found to be using it to film a racy website (which Homer helped spread), Ned moves away in shame. Homer genuinely misses Ned's absence, especially when a gruff, unneighborly man buys the house, and is overjoyed when Ned returns to Springfield. Also, despite Ned's friendly and easygoing nature, there are some times he gets into arguments or fights with Homer. For example, in the episode Dead Putting Society, Homer (Out of envy from thinking Ned has more than him) manipulates Ned into harshly making a bet with him in which the ""Father of the kids who doesn't win has to mow the other's lawn in their wife's Sunday dress"", which, despite Ned coming down cool with Homer in the end, Homer, in an effort to embarrass Ned, makes it clear that since their kids had tied, nobody wins, so they both have to go along with the bet (even though Ned actually has no problems with it). Another example is with the episode where they get jobs as bounty hunters, where, at first there bonding was solid (They agreed to be partners through a deal of where if Ned doesn't say his usual nonsensical dialog, while Homer does everything by in the job the ""book), but later on they began to object their respective deals, and then put an end to their partnership, though they later became on good terms again when Homer tries to help Ned from from falling down from their chase at the beam on the construction crane (though it ends south, as Homer ends up falling off too with Ned when trying to save him, and they both end up in cement, which drys up before they could get out). In a more recent episode I Won't Be Home For Christmas, Homer sees Flanders selling things for his Leftorium. Homer asks Ned how he stays so happy and Ned says that God and his family are all he has left since Edna died. Ned starts crying after all the misfortune he suffered and because his business is failing. Homer then buys something from his store to make him feel better, showing the true friendship between Homer and Flanders. Homer has correlation with the deaths of both of Ned’s wives, when he got Maude knocked over a top row of bleachers by t-shirts, and apparently hitting Edna Krabappel with his car.
 His friendship with Bart began in The Simpsons Movie. When Bart becomes a camper, he would seem to have taken a liking to his head camper, Ned Flanders. During a time when Homer was being an exceptionally bad father, Ned was his surrogate. This is shown by Bart talking in Flanders normal diddly-doodily fashion. However, Ned reassures Bart that Homer is his true father, and that Bart must be a receptive son in order to help Homer be a concerned father during Springfield's darkest hour.
 Ned Flanders is irritatingly optimistic and cheerful. Religion has removed all gray areas in life for him, so he and his family live secure, knowing that the ultimate safety net that is Heaven awaits for them. Ned believes the Bible has all the answers. Sometimes as many as two or three very different ones for the same question. His constant fretting over every rule Biblical rule exasperates even the bland Rev. Lovejoy. Ned keeps kosher ""just on the safe side."" This Starkly contrasts to his upbringing as Ned's parents lived like freaky beatniks without believing in any rules. As a result, Ned learn to repress all his anger and learned turn the other cheek. And, with Homer Simpson as a neighbor. Ned has had to turn every cheek on his body.
 Ned's special calling is to make the world a better place for the left-handed. To this end, he owns and operates The Leftorium down at the Springfield Mall. His volunteerism extends into the community, whereas a member of the junior campers, sponsored a Spongebath the Old Folks Day. Before she fell to her death at the race track, Ned's relationship with his wife Maude had been unabashedly corny and romantic-he once serenaded her dressed as an ornate heart-shaped box of candy. The one fracture in their practically perfect union occurred when Maude underlined passages in Ned's Bible.
 In spite of Maude's untimely demise, Ned, Rod, and Todd are a model family in nearly every way. Consequently, they are regarded as an unsettling curiosity by nearly everyone, and as a very personal annoyance by Homer. Everything the Simpsons have or do, the Flanders have a little more or do a little better. In ""Land Behemoth"", for instance, Flanders motor home is bigger than Homer's motor home, and in ""Propane Elaine,"" Ned's grill is more expensive than Homer's grill. The exceptions to this rule are the things in the Simpson household that Homer has ""borrowed"" from Flanders, more or less permanently. But don't think that the relationship between the families is one-sided. There is some give with all they take. Though Homer's example, Todd Flanders has learned to curse.
 The Flanders family members constantly help each other out as study-buddies, pray-partners, and stratego-amigos. Together, they enjoy bible stories, taffy pull, flag ceremonies, and cable TV, though they've locked out all the channels, except the religious ones. Their home is tailored to reflect their religious beliefs with such items as Shroud of Turin beach towels, Lot's Wife salt shakers, and a doorbell that rings ""Kumbaya"". In short, the Flanders family strive to do everything the Bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff.
 Flanders as The Devil in ""Treehouse of Horror IV"", portrayed as such due to being ""the one you least suspect"". In the ""Treehouse of Horror IV"" segment ""The Devil and Homer Simpson"", Flanders appeared as the devil in front of Homer Simpson (quoted by Flanders, ""It's always the one you least expect!"") and when he comes to claim Homer's soul, he and Bart exchange casual greetings. He acts as the ""unquestioned Lord and Master of the world"" (in a parallel universe) in a segment in ""Treehouse of Horror V"", he instituted Orwellian ""Re-Neducation"" facilities for those with impure thoughts culminating in frontal lobotomies. In other Halloween episodes, he proclaimed his preference for ""wanton carnality"" as an early Pilgrim immigrant to the New World, only to be vetoed by Maude; been transformed into a werewolf; been murdered by Homer Simpson (who used the rise of a zombie horde as an excuse for killing him) (Homer Simpson: ""He was a zombie?""— Homer didn't care if Ned was actually zombie or not), a clone of Homer Simpson, and an evil bus-gremlin whom he attempted to adopt. 
 In the opening of ""Treehouse of Horror XXX"", when Ned sees Maggie's devilish abilities and attempts to kill her at a abandoned church, Homer and Marge try to stop him, but Ned shows them that Maggie 'bears the mark of the beast'. He shows, under her hair, a mark that looks like Mickey Mouse. This is the wrong mark, however, and the real mark is the numbers '666', the number of the Devil. Before Ned can kill Maggie, she rises in the air, and breaks open the roof of the church. Homer states that Maggie still better than another boy, and all three of them get giant wooden stakes through their hearts. 
 In ""Bart to the Future"", Bart sees his own future. Ned is seen blind, revealing that he received laser eye surgery, which was great at the beginning, but after the 10-year-point, your eyes fall out. He often bails Bart out with money as a way of thanking him for not ""outing"" Rod and Todd.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", Ned is shown to have his eyes and is shown to still be Homer's happy neighbor. He also stated that Edna was killed by Homer and Ned is shown to be married with Maude's ghost.
 In ""Flanders' Ladder"", he marries several women in Springfield including Marge.
 In The Simpsons Road Rage, Ned Flanders is a driver that you can unlock. While not being played, he is a passenger.
 In The Simpsons Game, Ned is carjacked by Martin Prince in the level ""Mob Rules"", so he joins Marge's mob to stop the game Grand Theft Scratchy to be sold to kids.
 Ned was an unlockable character in Simpsons Wrestling. His special moves are summoning lightning and he can get up once after being pinned.
 One of the many Flanders merchandise, Flander's Book of Faith The writers found Harry Shearer's voice for Flanders so sweet that they decided to make the character a Christian. Ned as a child Ned Flanders, who was designed by Rich Moore, first appeared in the season one episode ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"". The episode was the series premiere, but not the first episode produced. The first episode in which Flanders and his family were prominent is season two's ""Dead Putting Society"", which also contained the first appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders. Flanders was named after Flanders St. in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. Groening described the inspiration for Flanders as ""just a guy who was truly nice, that Homer had no justifiable reason to loathe, but then did"". It was not until after the first few episodes that it was decided Flanders would be a faithful Christian. Mike Scully noted that Flanders is ""everything Homer would love to be, although he'll never admit it"". Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but Harry Shearer used ""such a sweet voice"" and Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to Homer. Flanders is known for his nonsensical jabbering, and his first use of the word ""diddly"" was in ""The Call of the Simpsons"". It was also believed that Ned Flanders was a caricaturization of Matt Groening, but the animators later insisted that Ned's design of looking like Groening without a beard was entirely coincidental.
 Ned Flanders was not religious in his first few appearances and in the first few seasons he was only mildly religious and his primary role was to be so ""cloyingly perfect as to annoy and shame the Simpsons"", whereas Homer Simpson has always hated Ned Flanders and always tries to undermine him. There has been a consistent effort among the show's writers to make him not just ""goody good and an unsympathetic person"". In the later seasons, Flanders has become more of a caricature of the Christian right, and his role as an irritating ""perfect neighbor"" has been lessened.
 Ned's store ""The Leftorium"" first appeared in ""When Flanders Failed"". It was suggested by George Meyer, who had had a friend who had owned a left-handed specialty store that failed. The episode ""Hurricane Neddy"" shows Ned's faith being tested and the writers also used the episode as a chance to examine what makes him tick.
 There have been two occasions where Flanders was not voiced by Harry Shearer. In ""Bart of Darkness"", Flanders's high pitched scream was performed by Tress MacNeille and in ""Homer to the Max"", Flanders comments about cartoons being easily able to change voice actors and on that occasion he was voiced by Karl Wiedergott.
 ""The Adventures of Ned Flanders"" was a short that appeared at the end of the episode ""The Front"". Entitled Love that God, it highlights the Flanderses' dedication to religion and perfect family niceness, yet again. Ned nearly scolds Rod and Todd, who are busy praying, after they refuse to get ready for church — only to be told that it is, in fact, a Saturday. Ned laughs at his mistake with a trademark ""Okily-dokily!"" According to commentary on 22 Short Films About Springfield, The Simpsons team wanted to do more ""Adventures of Ned Flanders"" shorts. Time limitations have prevented them from producing more. Ironically, the reason why ""The Adventures of Ned Flanders"" was first conceived was that they couldn't expand the episode to fill up the remaining time gap.
 In January and February 2001, Ned's influence among the American evangelical community was recognized in Christian Century and Billy Graham's Christianity Today.
 Everyone Loves Ned Flanders The Front Version Everyone Loves Ned Flanders is a song in the episodes ""The Front"" and ""Ned 'N Edna's Blend"". It's also the theme for The Adventures of Ned Flanders.
 From ""The Front"":
 Hens love roosters.
Geese love ganders.
Everyone else loves Ned Flanders!
Homer: Not me.
Chorus: Everyone who counts loves Ned Flanders!
 Flanders: Knock that off, you two. It's time for church.
Todd: We're not going to church today.
Flanders: (gasps) What? You give me one good reason!
Rod: It's Saturday.
Flanders: (chuckles) Okelly-dokelly-do!
 Hens love roosters.
Geese love ganders.
Everyone else loves Ned Flanders!
 From ""Ned 'N Edna's Blend"":
 Hens love roosters.
Geese love ganders.
Everyone else loves Ned Flanders!
 Ned: My mustache is grizzly,
My letters are dissly,
And I don't wanna missly you,
I'd like to hug and kissly.
 Edna: Ha!
 Ned: First base, yo.
I like Christian rap,
A bible on my lap.
 Homer: Will you stop this stupid crap?
I want to take a nap!
 Ned: Okelly-dokelly!

Todd Flanders,True,True,False,False,False,1,Cartwright,37,"Pamela Hayden Todd Homer Flanders is the youngest son of Ned and Maude Flanders and a stepson to Edna Krabappel. He is the most impressionable and youngest member of the Flanders family. He wears brown shoes, bluish-green shorts, a pink polo shirt and sports the ""Devil's Curly Hair"".
 Todd is very impressionable, more so than Rod, his brother. In one episode, Todd himself starts to curse. An example would be after Todd heard Homer cursing, he had said ""Hell, no"" and ""I said I don't want any damn vegetables"" at the dinner table. When Moe Szyslak loses his temper at Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag restaurant, Todd responds with ""Ow, my freaking ears!"". Due to relentless sheltering by his parents, whenever Todd comes into contact with anything outside his family and their pious ways, such as the time he and Rod were tricked into eating a Pixy Stix by Bart Simpson, he turns nasty, telling his older brother to ""go to hell, zit-face"", much to the delight of Bart . He is often the only one of the Flanders' to question his faith, much to the chagrin of Ned. He typically dresses in shorts and on some occasions wears a floppy ""newsboy"" cap. After the death of Maude in a freak accident caused by Homer Simpson, Rod and Todd became somewhat withdrawn and even more religious; when Ned married Edna Krabappel, however, they began to act more like normal children. Both boys also spied on Bart and Lisa being bathed in the backyard of the Simpsons house, though they tried to deny it upon being spotted.
 Todd can play the violin quite well and is a part of the Springfield Elementary School band. He also plays miniature golf quite well. Both himself and Rod quote rhymes Ned has taught them such as 'Users are losers' and 'Smokers are Jokers'. Todd was born 2 years after Lisa Simpson, as shown in the 700th episode ""Manger Things"". That would make him 6-years-old in canon. 
 Flanders' Book of Faith reveals that he used to wet the bed relatively recently but doesn’t anymore. 
 In his teens, Todd falls in love with a woman named Jenda, who later dates Bart. At age 40, Todd, with his brother, Rod, is hinted to be LGBT. They live with their father, who uses his pension to pay for their estrogen treatments. At age 40, he and Rod still live with Ned and take care of him because his eyes fell out.
 Todd appears along with his brother Rod Flanders and Ralph Wiggum as Hobbit-like children who help Homer and Marge defeat the two-headed dragon in order to get the Keycard.
 In the first segment ""Treehouse of Horror XXI"", he is killed in one the board games.
 There is also some controversy as to which of the two is the elder. The commentator golf tournament states that Todd is 10. One of the corrections that the TV-magazine show Rock Bottom makes in the episode ""Homer Badman"" is to their claim that ""the older Flanders boy is Todd, not Rod"". (Although this could have been included purely to stir up fans). Later, the Flanders family eat out for Rod's ""big ten-o"", suggesting the two are of similar age (however, the present time in at least one other Simpsons episode has been set two years before that of others). However, Lisa, when babysitting Rod and Todd, tells a story about a robot named Todd who ""had a brother named Rod, who was two space years older than him"". Todd responds by saying, ""I don't like this story!"" In the episode ""Manger Things"", Todd is shown to be younger than Lisa Simpson as he was born after her.
 As Rod is shown to be quite a bit taller than Todd, the claim that Todd is the older brother is disputed. Both Rod and Todd were born before Lisa (who is 8), Todd appearing a younger age than Bart (who is 10) and when Bart was entering ""the terrible twos"".
 Despite these discrepancies, the Simpsons official website states that “Todd is the youngest and most impressionable member of the happy Flanders clan”. This seems to trump any inconsistency concerning age seen in the episodes. On the other hand, the character profile for Rod Flanders in The Simpsons: A Complete Guide To Our Favorite Family describes him as the ""youngest of the Springfield Flanders."", but they have made a few mistakes in that book. Another possible reason for the variation is that, in the DVD commentaries for show, the writers have stated that they are never sure which Flanders sibling is Rod and which one is Todd and are often forced to check character models to be sure. According to the commentary, early show writers used two different mnemonics to identify the taller brother; first that Todd started with T and was Taller, or that Rod was long like a rod and hence taller.

Barney Gumble,True,False,False,False,True,1,Castellaneta,38,"Helicopter pilot Barnard Arnold ""Barney"" Gumble, Sr. (born April 20) is the Springfield town drunk who often works as human guinea pig for medical research facilities. He is Homer Simpson's best friend, although to a lesser extent after high school. Being a frequent customer at Moe's (to the point of sleeping there) Barney considers Moe to be his second best friend; however, he is often abused by Moe and Arnie Gumble in the process, mainly due to Moe's personality. Barney was formerly an A-student back at Springfield High, but lost it all due to his drinking alcohol. When he sings, he has a very nice voice. This talent was discovered by the Be Sharps when Barney was in the men's restroom.
 He is a recurring character in The Simpsons and a minor character in The Simpsons Movie.
 Barney was born on April 20. His father, Arnie Gumble, was killed in a parade float accident along with Sheldon Skinner, Iggy Wiggum, Etch Westgrin, and Griff McDonald, all of whom had served in Abe Simpson's WWII squad, the Flying Hellfish. Barney once had a near-death experience in which he expects to be reunited with ""my loved ones, my dad, and that plant I never watered,"" perhaps implying that he did not get along with his father.
 As a teenager, Barney had great potential. He was Harvard-bound until Homer introduced him to beer on the night before they had to take the SATs. It has also been implied that he took to drinking after his high-school sweetheart, Chloe Talbot, left Springfield to become a successful TV reporter. In spite of the years of alcoholism, he still appears to maintain some of his great early potential. For example, when forced to quit drinking while training to be an astronaut, he almost immediately regained his diction and balance and proved to be an exceptional astronaut candidate. (Unfortunately, to celebrate the completion of his training and selection as an astronaut, he was given non-alcoholic champagne, which immediately resulted in a relapse.)
 
Later on, with Homer, he was a member of The Be Sharps barbershop quartet, in which his stellar Irish singing voice was discovered. Barney showed his artistic side again when he won top prize at the Springfield Film Festival for his moving documentary about his life as an alcoholic, unfortunately titled ""Pukahontas"". Action Figure Barney Mr. Black also hired Barney to act like Krusty the Clown for the campers at Kamp Krusty, although Bart was not fooled by his attempt at defaming Krusty (as Barney was poorly disguised as Krusty), and also ends up confirming Bart and the rest of the campers' suspicions that Black just ""slapped a clown suit on some wine-o"" by answering that he is ""Krunchy the Clown,"" as well as clamoring for Krusty's return (or, as he calls him, ""Krunchy"").
 Barney was inspired by Homer's Mr. Plow business to have his own snow removal service, calling himself the Plow King and buying a snow removal truck much bigger than Homer's. He even got Linda Ronstadt to sing on his commercials. ""We've been looking for a project to do together for a while,"" he explained. He took away all Homer's customers and earned the key to Springfield (which was taken away from Homer). Homer eventually fools Barney into traveling to ""Forbidding Widows' Peak"" to plow through the snow for a $10,000 bill, but is caught in an avalanche. Homer ends up saving Barney, they become friends again and team up, only to find the snow melting (after Homer comments ""When two best friends team up, not even God himself can stop them."" To which a voice from the sky replies ""Oh, no?"" and promptly beams down a ray of light to melt the snow), and Homer's truck repossessed. Barney is seen driving his plow as the Plow King again in several occasions.
 When Mr. Burns caused Moe's Tavern to close down and was shot later, Barney became a major suspect for shooting Burns after Burns blocked the sun (despite his easygoing nature, Barney apparently carries around a derringer at all times).
 Barney, drinking with friends Lenny, Carl, Sam and Larry. Barney served in the United States Navy Reserve for a short time, as a submariner on the USS Jebediah with his own mother as his superior officer, although he briefly served in the U.S. Army during his youth.
 Barneey  Before Barney started drinking, he was a very intelligent young man, but while studying for the S.A.T.s Homer offered him one of Abe's beers. After giving in to Homer, Barney took his first sip and quickly downed the entire can. His clothes and hair quickly became a mess and he ran out of Homer's house.
Barney is almost always seen in Moe's Tavern, where he is a regular. His desperation for alcohol has been the source of many jokes. He has a quavering, slightly broken voice and a distinctive loud belch (although he sings completely differently, having a beautiful ""Irish tenor"" type voice), as well as a characteristic wandering eye. He remains friendly and good-natured despite his unfortunate condition. Heavyset, slovenly, and unmarried (though occasionally seen with women), he lives in a very untidy and sparsely-furnished apartment. It has also been implied that he has ""lived"" in Moe's Tavern. Barney drinks so compulsively that Moe had to send his beer tab to NASA for it to be calculated: it ultimately came out as fourteen billion dollars worth of beer (although Moe mistakenly stated it was seventy billion dollars until he realized that that was actually the cost of the Voyager Spacecraft), and has contributed to at least one of his fellow barflies' beer tab (such as when Homer went to Japan). Naked Barney He is occasionally seen doing some sort of manual labor, such as working for his Uncle Al at Barney's Bowlarama, but has also been the owner of a successful snowplowing business and been employed by NASA as an astronaut. Barney is 40 years old and his first name was revealed to be Bernard, although he also appears to be in the same high school class as Homer in flashbacks. When streaking at his high school prom earned him ""about a decade's worth of detention"", it was hinted that he was either to be held back a year, or had already repeated. He had also ended up having to do court-issued community service with picking up roadside litter where he attacked Principal Skinner (who was trying to cross the interstate with a tank of gasoline for his car at the time) after hallucinating that Skinner was a giant beer can.
 Barney has survived experiences such as exploding zeppelins, malfunctioning Jet packs, and being crushed by a falling table.
 Barney also apparently takes pictures of Legs's sister, as stated in ""Homie the Clown"" when Homer states he is ""Barney Gumble"" after the mob picks him up thinking he is Krusty.
 Barney drinks varnish When alcohol is not readily available, Barney is seen drinking just about anything, such as turpentine, varnish, rubbing alcohol, and brake fluid. In addition, when someone forces him to be sober from alcohol, he sometimes becomes murderous and deranged, which happened on at least two occasions. The first time was when Mr. Burns diverted all the beer from Springfield and then issued a manhunt on TV to force Homer to give back Bobo, to which Barney was at the door with a gun warning Homer to do as Mr. Burns said, although he ended up accidentally shooting and presumably killing a woman who was crossing Evergreen Terrace after Homer slammed the door in his face, and it is implied that he was arrested for this action shortly thereafter. The second time was when, due to Mr. Burns' slant drilling operation forcing Moe's Tavern to close due to the toxic fumes, he brought out a gun with the intention of wanting to murder Mr. Burns for this, although he never actually got a chance to use it before Mr. Burns was shot by Maggie. He also utilized his gun once while acting as the Plow King, to shoot out Homer's Mr. Plow truck's tires.
 According to Homer in what ultimately inspired Barney to become sober, Barney's exact stance at being inebriated depended on how he acted: When slightly inebriated during his birthday party (by comparison, as Barney did not remember the birthday party), or as Homer called him ""Professor Barney"", he was talkative, coherent (at least by comparison) and even insightful, albeit somewhat offensive, as he was telling Lisa that upon death, there will be a planet each for the French, the Chinese, and presumably any other nationality/ethnicity with the implication that they'd all be happier that way, much to the latter's chagrin. When extremely drunk, however, he at one point managed to somehow cross-dress as Marge and yell to the kids in a fake falsetto voice that he's going shopping before drinking while overall being very woozy, enough to fall over the banister, and upon seeing beer soaked into the ""shag"" (referring into the rug), he proceeds to lap it up like a dog and even get territorial when Santa's Little Helper was nearby, with Homer, initially mistaking him for Marge, telling ""her"" that ""she's"" making a fool of herself before realizing ""her"" true identity.
 A sober Barney In very early episodes such as There's No Disgrace Like Home he was portrayed as a bully who regularly picked on Homer and would start fights with him.
 When he was nominated alongside Homer to join NASA, Barney quit drinking to undergo the rigorous training. He succeeded and was even nominated to go into space. However, due to the severity of his alcoholism, a taste of non-alcoholic champagne was enough to get him intoxicated again, thus resulting in Homer going to space instead of Barney.
 Barney was once forced to remain sober for the drinking night at Moe's when he received the position of Designated Driver that night (coincidentally on the same night that he was to win a bottomless glass of Duff from Duffman). The mental strain of that single night of sobriety sent Barney on a two-month bender with Homer's car, after which Barney remembered nothing except for a guest lecture he gave at Villanova (or maybe it was on a street corner). The car was later found parked illegally in New York City, though Barney had no memory of how it got there.
 Barney once attempted to kick his alcoholism habit. For his birthday, Moe gave him a gift certificate for helicopter flying lessons, not expecting Barney to actually use them. ""Can you imagine this tanked-up loser at the wheel of a whirlybird?"" Moe asked. This comment, coupled with a humiliating videotape of Barney's actions while inebriated, gave Barney the drive he needed. Barney attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, became sober, and took the helicopter lessons. He became fairly proficient at it, though he admitted he had not yet mastered right turns. This new skill helped Homer rescue Bart and Lisa from a forest fire, although he initially panicked and almost ended up reverting to alcoholism in a desperate attempt at tackling his panic until Homer selflessly downed a significant amount of beer specifically to avoid Barney reverting back to his alcoholism, resulting in Homer becoming extremely inebriated in the process. Unwilling to lose one of his most crucial customers to his tavern, Moe figured out a way to channel Barney's tendency for addiction into a dependency on the caffeine in espressos. Aside from his alcoholism, he was also addicted to caffeinated products, as aside from Moe figuring out how to keep a then-sober Barney as his customer as noted above, the thing that set him off to try and eliminate the dome during the Trappuccino incident was the book club accidentally destroying what was presumably the last batch of coffee, and may have been addicted to tobacco products, as he was smoking a cigar during the 1990's (even quickly burning through a single cigar, only to feel ill presumably from inhaling so much tobacco, causing him to involuntarily belch out enough of a smokescreen that Moe attempted to steal a patron's watch before it dissipated), and when saved by Stampy from a tar pit he while walking away attempted to light a cigarette only to end up immolating himself.
 Barney once made a movie about his struggle with alcoholism and submitted it to the Springfield Film Festival. When he won the grand prize, he vowed to remain clean and sober from that point forward, but quickly backed off his vow when it was announced that the grand prize was a lifetime supply of Duff Beer.
 Barney drinking as Ulysses S. Grant Homer encouraged Barney to drink a beer when he played Ulysses S. Grant in a reenactment of the Battle of Springfield. (Surprisingly, this did not cause him to become alcoholic again. Barney himself was both surprised and hesitant to drink the beer, even for his role, as he was a recovering alcoholic.) He briefly sobered up and got back behind the controls of his helicopter to rescue his old girlfriend Chloe from a volcanic lava flow. He was also relatively sober and piloting his helicopter again when helping Homer take celebrity photographs. When he suggested that an indicted Marge go to a particular rehab clinic to help her kick her drinking habit, he stated that the clinic had ""cured him five times,"" implying that he has been switching between a current and recovering alcoholic. It's revealed that he's always sober in the morning until he enters Moe's Tavern.
 During Trappuccino, he was one of the barflies who ran into the church, and was in the massive angry mob set out to kill Homer with the rest of the townspeople. Even later, Barney was attending an AA meeting and went crazy when the coffee ran out.
 If there's one thing Barney Gumble loves more than beer, he hasn't discovered it yet. And not for want of trying. Hard liquor, sterno, cough syrup, turpentine, he's tried them all. Once, in a fit of desperation, he drank some non-alcoholic champagne, with near-fatal consequences. But Beer! Wonderful Beer! Barney would kill his own brain for a beer. He's drunk beer out of ashtrays, sucked beer our of bar rags, licked windows made of beer bottles, and, realizing a dream come true, drunk straight from the tap until his heart stopped. As he's said more than once, ""If Moe's Tavern didn't close, I'd never leave.""
 When not entertaining the rest of the barflies with his lip-rippling belches, Barney seeks semi-occasional employment. He has worked as a sneeze-guard tester, handed out pamphlets dressed in a diaper for Lullabuy$ Baby Shop, appeared as a float in a temperance parade, and made regular donations to the Springfield Sperm Bank. However he was also given the key to the city for his heroics as the Plow King, and won a Grammy as tenor singer for Be Sharps, a barbershop quartet comprised of Homer, Apu, Skinner, and Barney. His romantic life, also semi-occasional, has ranger from Linda Ronstadt and Japanese conceptual artist Kako to Selma Bouvier to the woman in front of the drugstore who's always yelling things.
 Being the swinging single that he is, Barney's apartment is decorated in an early 70's style -- replete with cable spool table, Farrah Fawcett poster, and empty pizza-box motif. A style guaranteed to keep Barney a swinging single forever. For this fundamentally existential lifestyle, Barney owes Homer Simpson thanks. They have been friends since high school and it was Homer, on the eve of the all-important SAT test, introduced Barney to his first beer, sparing him the shame of an Ivy League education and the burden of steady employment.
 In ""Bart to the Future"", an elderly Barney watches Bart and Ralph's band perform Tequila Mockingbirds and boos them off the stage.
 In the first segment Hell Toupée, he is seen watching the execution of Snake Jailbird.
 In the first segment Untitled Robot Parody, he is tied up along with The Simpsons, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Manjula, Seymour Skinner, Janey Powell, Gerald Samson, Milhouse Van Houten, Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Moe Szyslak, Edna Krabappel, Groundskeeper Willie, Barney Gumble, Sideshow Mel, Ned Flanders and his boys. While the transformers play Foosball.
 Barney has a couple minor roles in the missions for Level 1. The first, Petty Theft Homer, had Homer going to Barney to retrieve Ned Flanders' Cooler, as Homer had earlier stolen it, and was working fast to retrieve it and other belongings in order to avoid the police catching on to him (as Ned reported it to them, unaware that Homer was responsible). Based on comments made between the two, Homer supplied the cooler as a birthday present to Barney, and the latter had proceeded to use it as a toilet before being forced to give it back to Flanders. The second, Office Spaced, had Homer going over to Barney to borrow his Plow King vehicle, as he needed a powerful vehicle to total Mr. Burns' Limo in order to delay Smithers long enough for Homer to arrive at his work station before an inspection was due to occur. Barney agreed, though it's implied that his main reason for agreeing was due to being drunk at the time or at least drugged, as he referred to Homer as a ""sexy leprechaun"" and begged to not have a dart gun pointed at him.
 While Barney doesn't have an actual role in level 2, he has a brief cameo in Moe's Tavern where he is drinking beer when Bart visits the location.
 Barney later reappears in Level 5, and specifically has a role in the mission Getting Down with the Clown. He tells Bart (whom he refers to as ""little Homer"") that Krusty's not at Krustylu Studios as he went down to the Squidport as part of a promotional gig for the new Buzz Cola. When Bart stated that the new Buzz Cola was designed by aliens to control human behavior, Barney is in disbelief that a beverage could do that, only to end up breaking down upon realizing that he hadn't actually had a Duff Beer in over two hours. Bart and he then ""planned"" to have the former beat Krusty's Limo to Squidport, while the latter stayed behind to go through the DTs. Based on his uniform, it's implied he was working as a security guard at Krustylu Studios during that time.
 Barney first appears as one of the contestants in the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge in the level Around the World in 80 Bites. He also appears in Mob Rules as one of the people Marge can use to protest the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy video game to minors, although some of his comments implied he was more concerned with using the mob as an outlet for his alcoholism than in the actual intended goal.
 Barney when he had blond hair. Barney was partly based on ""Crazy"" Guggenheim, a character from Jackie Gleason's American Scene Magazine. Matt Groening noted: ""Barney was taking the standard sitcom sidekick and just making him as pathetic as possible. And also there was a sort of unspoken rule about not having drinking on television as a source of comedy. So, of course, we went right for it. In ""Days of Wine and D'oh'ses"" Barney was sobered up, a move that many staff members were against believing ""a wide-awake, freshly showered, sober Barney just isn't as funny as an unkempt, disoriented, drunk one."" Castellaneta did not change his voice after the sobering, because "" still got 15 years of booze left in his veins.""
 The name Barney Gumble is a parody (and near homonym) of Barney Rubble, Fred Flintstone's best friend on Hanna-Barbera's TV show The Flintstones. In several of the episodes of the first season, Barney Gumble's hair was yellow, just like Barney Rubble's hair. He was also born on April 20.
 Barney first appeared in the episode ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"", in which he worked as a department store Santa and gave Homer a tip for winning at the dog track. The Season 1 DVD indicates that the script writers originally intended for Barney to be Homer's next-door neighbor.
 His voice sounds almost identical to Marvin the Martian from Looney Tunes.
 Barney is also a major character on the show and has been central in a few episodes such as ""Mr. Plow"", ""Homer's Barbershop Quartet"", and ""Days of Wine and D'oh'ses"". Barney has also appeared in every single season although in season 19 he made only cameo appearances. In seasons 2-5, Barney made lots of speaking appearances approximately 10-15 episodes, because he was always seen in Moe's tavern. He has appeared in 274 episodes.

Dewey Largo,True,True,False,False,False,1,Shearer,39,"Deward ""Dewey"" Largo, MMus, is the music teacher whom Lisa credited with proving that any piece of music could have the soul sucked out of it. He is very counter-creative and is a poor conductor. He is also 53 years old, and seems depressed/hot tempered.
 In ""Homer's Paternity Coot"", a letter in the frozen postman's bag reveals that as a child, Largo was accepted to the Juilliard School of Music, but never got the letter as it was frozen atop Mt. Springfield. His assumed rejection from this school could explain his eventual lack of passion for music.
 Mr. Largo is the music teacher at Springfield Elementary School. He is one of the more uptight and mean teachers at the school. Largo teaches Lisa's band class where he often stifles her creativity. He only teaches simple, boring and unoriginal songs to the band causing Lisa to often cause outbursts in class. Despite this, he can occasionally encourage excellent performances from his students, leading them in playing ""Living in America.""  
 Once, Mr. Largo had to take over for Groundskeeper Willie for a short time while Willie was working at The Gilded Truffle. He turned out to be even worse at being groundskeeper than music teacher. He once carpooled with Smithers, but ended up getting into a multi-car pileup thanks in part to Bart stealing the sign ""Bart Bvd."" as part of a dare by Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. When Homer (dressed as the Safety Salamander) saved the two of them from the car, Largo stated that they were carpooling, and ended it right there. He wanted to have a sex change operation to look like Julie Newmar, but ended up becoming shorter instead because Dr. Nick mixed up his surgery file with Moe's. Dewey Largo presumably had Nelson fix up his bike, but then, due to Nelson unknowingly using a Water Soluble glue, it collapsed during a parade he was in (implied to be a gay pride parade), and he angrily returned it to Nelson. He graduated Springfield University.
 In ""Flaming Moe"", Dewey quits and claims to have found his soulmate (also named Dewey) and goes to Moe's. However, he is still seen in the opening sequence and later episodes, teaching the music class.
 In ""Girl's in the Band"", he is shown waking up in the morning sharing the bed with a man named Geoffrey who apparently stays home all day while Dewey works. Dewey and Geoffrey are still in a relationship as of season 35.
 His last name is also an Italian word for a slow, broad musical tempo, a possible reference to the fact that he can make any piece of music uninteresting, or that Largo is a musical term that means broad or slow.
 Largo is voiced by Harry Shearer and was once voted the worst character created.

Lewis Jackson,True,False,False,False,False,1,MacNeille,40,"Lewis Clark is a student in Springfield Elementary School. He is one of Bart's friends, and one of only a handful of African-American students at the school. His best friend is Richard.
 Lewis is one of Bart's friends and fellow fourth-graders in Mrs. Krabappel's class. He once annoyed a guilt-ridden Bart when he hid under a pile of leaves and pretended to be Principal Skinner's corpse, and he failed to vote for Bart in the class presidential election. He is most commonly seen playing in the schoolyard or elsewhere with his friend Richard.
 Lewis was one of the children in the Model UN Club that were stranded on an island and, thinking he was going to die, Bart mistook him for Wendell. Lewis also plays on the Mighty Pigs pee-wee hockey team and according to gossip is a very good ballroom dancer. He apparently owns a gun as he was seen discharging it in school during the episode  as the class cheered after learning they were going to have a movie day.
 In The Simpsons Game, Lewis witnessed Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph go through the museum and tells Homer and says it's the first sign of the Apocalypse. Later, he doesn't know how he feels about Homer saving the Museum. Lewis found out about the Eating Contest at the Duff Brewery and tells Homer. Lewis watches the Eating Contest on TV and strangely gets the sense that Homer could've eaten more at the Eating Contest. Lewis later gets the New Grand Theft Scratchy with the other school kids and later with the kids they randomly appear in places of the city causing mayhem. The game is later banned by Marge, Lisa, and the Mob. Lewis later sees the aliens attacking the Mall, Lard Lad attacking, and The Dolphins. Lewis laughs and guessed that Lard Lad messed with the Wrong Fat Man. Lewis later wonders if the aliens Homer killed went to Heaven.
 In The Simpsons Game, Lewis is voiced by Pamela Hayden.
 In earlier seasons, Lewis could be considered as Bart's second-best friend. As the roles of Nelson and Milhouse were enlarged, Lewis was seen with Bart less and less often and was finally returned to Background character status.
 Throughout the series, Lewis has been voiced by Jo Ann Harris, Nancy Cartwright, Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Maggie Roswell. Because of the fact that he rarely speaks, he does not have a specific voice actor.
 His most recent speaking role is in ""Stealing First Base"", when after Edna Krabappel's class is moved to another classroom, he asks a student if he can sit with him. He was seen with Nina Skalka at the Le Petite Appetit during the episode, ""The Daughter Also Rises"". It's likely the two were dating during the episode and it's possible Nina is Lewis' girlfriend.
 Lewis normally wears a tanned shirt with a single cream stripe, green shorts, and tanned shoes. He has black hair. In ""Bart of Darkness"", he was seen wearing orange swimming trunks. In the episode ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"", his hair color and skin complexion changed during one scene in the episode. At night, he wears purple pajamas and purple slippers.

Santa%27s Little Helper,True,True,False,False,True,1,Azaria,41,"Santa's Little Helper (born May 12, possibly in 1981), also known as No. 8 (his number in the dog race in ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire""), Suds McDuff (the name he changed to after becoming Duff Beer's mascot in ""Old Yeller-Belly""), and Santa's Stupid Name (Brian Griffin's nickname for him in ""The Simpsons Guy""), is the Simpson family's dog. Santa's Little Helper is one of few pets that have been with the Simpson's family the whole series.
 Oddly for a domestic dog, he has been shown to still be alive thirty years in the future, as a highly evolved canine with a large cerebellum (""Holidays of Future Passed"") and a creature stitched together out of pieces of both he and Snowball V, in which form he is known as ""Santa's Little Hybrid"" (""Days of Future Future"").
 Santa's Little Helper races at the Springfield Downs. Santa's Little Helper was born, along with 6 known siblings, to She Biscuit, a dog owned by Les Moore.  Eventually, after losing a race on Christmas Eve, he was abandoned and taken home by Homer and Bart.
 Homer was relying on a Christmas bonus to buy presents, but didn't get it. He was relying on this bonus because the jar of Christmas money that Marge accumulates for the family's Christmas treats was disposed of to pay for the removal of a tattoo that Bart got on his arm. Homer took the small amount of Christmas money he made working as Santa Claus at the Springfield Mall and bet it at the dog track. He had inside information on what dog was going to win, but instead bet on the ""long shot,"" Santa's Little Helper, believing his name to be a sign. Santa's Little Helper finished last (apparently, it was the latest in a long string of last-place finishes), and his frustrated owner abandoned him. Homer and Bart brought him home, and everyone was so happy with him that it was a merry Christmas after all.
 Snowball II, Maggie and Santa's Little Helper together for a picture Sometimes, Santa's Little Helper can be seen chewing on the newspaper and other objects in the Simpson's household (sometimes ignored or tolerated by the family), tearing up the furniture, digging holes in the backyard and eating food from the living room table. It is stated that Homer and Santa's Little Helper's birthdays are on the same day.
 With a few exceptions, Santa's Little Helper doesn't make any sound that resembles a bark. However, he does have an ability to think just like a person. Once, he made a sound similar to ""chewy"", and Homer writes it down in his review, amazed that the dog spoke English. He is also shown to have ridden a circus ball on his hind legs and speak the phrase 'We love... you!' in an attempt to be given some attention from the Simpson family. In addition, he was mascot of Duff Beer, and was known as Suds McDuff, a reference to a similar, real-life mascot named Spuds MacKenzie.
 Santa's Little Helper licking Bart Santa's Little Helper's life with the Simpsons is not always easy. Due to his disobedience and destructive behavior, the Simpson family nearly gave him away, but he passed an obedience class, allowing him to stay. Santa's Little Helper almost passed away from gastric torsion (referred to in the show as a ""twisting of the stomach"") because Homer initially couldn't afford $750 for the required operation. He also broke two legs when Bart's tree-house was demolished by Mr. Burns' slant oil well drill, the latter of which caused Bart to hate Burns immensely. Santa's Little Helper is sometimes a bad dog.
 At one time, Santa's Little Helper was shortly abandoned by Bart for Laddie, a purebred and very well-trained dog he bought from a mail-order catalog together with various other expensive gifts and gadgets. To do that, Bart used a credit card he applied for under the name of his dog, yet the credit card company misread the form and issued a card to Mr. ""Santos L. Halper"". Laddie learned many tricks that Santa's Little Helper was completely unable to perform (most notably a back flip, CPR and using a toilet). The Simpson family nearly forgot about their old pet, and Bart eventually gave him away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tried to get Santa's Little Helper back. When he finally found him, Santa's Little Helper was serving as a guide dog for a blind man named Mr. Mitchell, but eventually chose to return to his former owner, Bart.
 Santa's Little Helper growling at the Simpson family. Santa's Little Helper has also shown aptitude in other areas. When neglected by the Simpson family, he ran away, and was adopted by Mr. Burns, and made into a very fearsome guard dog. When Bart was searching for Santa's Little Helper, Bart managed to reawaken Santa's Little Helper's good memories of him. It shown that while the Simpson family sleeps in the night, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II both watch old episodes of ""Lassie"" on TV. When Homer and Marge are investigated by Child Protective Services, one of the things noted in the report is ""dogs mating on dining room table"", at which Santa's Little Helper shamefully turns away.
 
One time, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to school for show and tell, and Mrs. Krabappel and the entire class, except for Martin Prince are fascinated by him. Mrs. Krabappel feeds him cookies, and the class dotes on him, but they later put him away, and Santa's Little Helper gets into the heating ducts. This later indirectly causes Skinner to be fired. Homer and Santa's Little Helper sleeping on the floor He also becomes a great hero after he saves Homer in a cornfield maze, and then becomes enrolled as a police dog, teamed up with Officer Lou. Both Lou and Santa's Little Helper make a good team, foiling crimes together. After biting Bart's left leg (due to the fact he got furious when the court stated that he violated one of the police codes while catching Snake Jailbird), Santa's Little Helper is sent off by the Simpson family to live with Lou. Later on, once Springfield Elementary is in danger and Bart isn't able to escape, Santa's Little Helper comes in to save him, and goes back to living with the Simpsons. Unlike when he was the Duff mascot (which depicts the dog as a coward), Santa's Little Helper is depicted as a very brave and smart dog.
 Santa's Little Helper sleeping in his doghouse Santa's Little Helper has been implied to be bisexual. At the time, the Simpson family is watching a gay pride parade marching down Evergreen Terrace, and one of the groups marching is the Gay Dog Alliance. The marching dogs are clothed in a series of typically camp gay costumes, and Santa's Little Helper, showing excitement by panting, shows an interest in several of the dogs, one of whom winks at him. Santa's Little Helper's attempt to join the dogs is thwarted by the fact that he is currently on a leash, noticing his interest, Homer chooses to take the family away from the pride parade.
 He is a greyhound with tan fur. His rib cage is visible possibly because of being malnourished, but this isn't due to any form of neglect as the Simpson family is seen feeding Santa's Little Helper the proper amount of food and, on some occasions, too much. Greyhounds are also this thin in real life. His paws aren't detailed and only appear to be legs that end at a nub. His ears are in an arched shape.
 He sired twenty-five puppies with She's the Fastest in ""Two Dozen and One Greyhounds"", as well as another litter with Dr. Hibbert's poodle, Rosa Barks, in ""Today, I Am a Clown"".

 Fourth grade science teacher (""Bart the Murderer"")FiremanAssistant Groundskeeper (""Girls Just Want to Have Sums"") Walter Seymour Skinner or Seymour  Skinner (real name: Armin Tamzarian) is a recurring character in The Simpsons. He is the principal of Springfield Elementary School, and a stereotypical educational bureaucrat. He struggles to control the crumbling school and is constantly engaged in a battle against its inadequate resources, apathetic and bitter teachers, and often rowdy and unenthusiastic students, Bart Simpson being a standout example. A strict disciplinarian, Skinner has an uptight, militaristic attitude that stems from his years in the United States Army as a Green Beret, which included service in the Vietnam War, where he achieved the rank of a sergeant, according to his rank insignia. As a result of his service in the Vietnam War, he is often plagued by horrible memories of his involvement via post-traumatic stress disorder, sometimes even happening at the most inopportune of times. It is also implied that he received a severe injury during the Vietnam War on his posterior to require a metal plate to be installed in it.
 In late 2017-early 2018, an old segment of the show featuring Skinner and Superintendent Gary Chalmers having a luncheon went viral, spawning what has become known as the ""Steamed Hams"" meme.
 He was born in July 12th 1944, meaning he is 45 (in 1989).
 Principal Skinner with Groundskeeper Willie and children, trapped in school Out of genuine concern for the quality of education of his students, most of Skinner's actions revolve around ensuring the school has adequate funding. His constant desperate, and usually ineffective attempts at maintaining discipline are an effort to receive good reviews from the frequent inspections of his capricious, temperamental, and whimsical superior, Superintendent Chalmers - who makes no effort to hide his disapproval of Skinner. These inspections usually turn away due to Bart Simpson's elaborate pranks—which playoff Skinner's desperation for order. Over the years of pranks and inspections, though, Skinner has developed a love-hate relationship with each of them; when Skinner was fired and replaced by Ned Flanders, Bart found pranks less meaningful, due to Flanders's lax approach to discipline.
 Skinner at war In an accident involving both Skinner and Chalmers, Chalmers showed grief over Skinner before he realized he was still alive. Although he likes to maintain the image of a strict disciplinarian, he is often weak-willed and nervous and has a very unhealthy dependence on his mother who constantly makes demands from him. She addresses him by the nickname ""Spanky."" Also, it was heavily implied that Seymour Skinner suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from his days in Vietnam, where he spent eighteen months as a prisoner of war. Seeing his entire platoon devoured by an elephant was one of the many things that led to the development of his post-traumatic stress disorder. Once, his PTSD kicked in in the middle of trying to alert students of a prank that Bart pulled involving heart message candies with crude statements on the PA where he remembered his war buddy Johnny being killed while he was writing a Valentine's Day card for his girlfriend back at home, causing Bart to think he ""broke  brain"". However, one PTSD related episode didn't deal with the war itself, but rather his experiences after the war, where he was apparently spat upon by people who were presumably anti-Vietnam when he was earlier promised with a parade.
 Skinner at MENSA 
Skinner's unhealthy relationship with his mother began early: it is revealed that Agnes' pregnancy resulted in her failing to win a medal at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952. He originally was quite laid back as a principal, even going as far as to do a jump-flip to catch a Frisbee while telling a student to keep up with his studies, but it all changed when one of his students (Andy Hamilton) managed to fill the pool with worms and locked Skinner in the pool for the whole weekend (plus a Monday and he didn't come out of there until Tuesday morning), causing him to become serious and almost merciless in his approach on rules, even going as far as to shut down the pool and demoting Willie, the swim teacher, to groundskeeper. When Bart attempted to stop Krusty from diving into a worm-filled pool out of fear of Krusty becoming like Skinner, he accidentally blurted what happened to Skinner on the air, causing Skinner to angrily mutter sarcastically that his mother told him that Krusty the Clown was supposed to be a good influence, indicating that he was attempting to repress the traumatic memory. Bart also claimed that Skinner likes dog food when preparing something for Principal Skinner, although it is unclear whether he was being serious about this. Besides his job as Principal for Springfield Elementary School, he also worked as a member of MENSA and was also the acting referee and a major organizer of the annual Civil War reenactment of the Battle of Springfield. Seymour Skinner's mother Agnes Skinner At one point, when the Vice President's Assessment Test was coming up, Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers came up with a plan to lure all of the underachievers away from the test day by faking a perfect score on the pretest and then tricking them into going for a Chopper ride to a Pizza Party in Capital City (going as far as to disguise the School Bus as a chopper). However, when the plan reached fruition, Skinner ended up being betrayed by Superintendent Chalmers with the latter tricking Skinner into boarding the bus to ""get his sunglasses."" He then has to get the kids back to the school, and also saved Ralph Wiggum when he somehow managed to board a garbage barge, to which Skinner impresses Bart and the other underachievers by saving Wiggum using the Conservation of Angular Momentum. Luckily for them, the Garbage Barge was also heading to Springfield Elementary School, so Skinner reads the newly motivated underachievers The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn the rest of the way, and after returning, stops the Vice President's Test, and also re-institutes dancing in school.
 Seymour Skinner Seymour Skinner has shown to be a stern and strict principal of Springfield Elementary; at times though he has been clueless and incompetent and overpowered by truant students, apathetic and underpaid teachers and what has been officially classified as ""the worst school in the state"". He loves school so much to the point where he actually kept the school open during a snowstorm and proceeded to carry on with running it even when the teachers and most of the students didn't show up, which would result in everyone turning against him.
 Although presenting himself with the self-assured image of an authoritative disciplinarian, Skinner has shown to be a nervous, fidgety man despite his age and position of power he is always milquetoast around his dominating mother and bad-tempered superintendent. It is heavily implied that Skinner's tightfisted, militaristic view of how Springfield Elementary should be run is because of his time in the military as a drill sergeant where his platoon were unruly and uncontrollable buffoons and his tendency to come down hard on truants.
 Owing to his militaristic manner of running the Elementary school, he also tended to do meticulous inspections early in the school day, such as placing his finger and stroking the top of a locker to inspect for dust, personally inspecting and comparing the school clock with his pocket-watch to ensure it is accurate down to the very second, measuring the distance between a wall and a waste disposal can, and using a tuning fork to test the ring vibration of a school alarm system, which also gave Superintendent Chalmers, who attempted to go to the Teacher's Lounge at the time without being seen by Skinner to make a secret announcement planning Skinner's 20th Anniversary as School Principal, a very hard time sneaking past him undetected to such an extent that he bluntly said that not only did Skinner have ""a rod up  butt"", but that said rod had its own rod up its butt after barely arriving at the Teacher's Lounge undetected.
 Skinner's brand of class discipline is considerably harsh from handing out six hundred days detention for the theft of school textbooks to hanging Nelson by the scruff on a coat hook and shaving the hair off of Milhouse when a swear word was shaved into it. Once, he even had Bart disqualified from getting a free tour of the submarine just because he accidentally dragged water into the school, despite his uncharacteristic excellent behavior beforehand.
 Skinner's behavior is often rather spineless and somewhat naive. He holds an unusually close relationship with his mother, who he lives with and who is generally able to control him despite his age. He is highly uncomfortable with swearing, criminal activity, and sexual topics; he was a virgin until his 40's, and he considers certain past actions like stealing a cupcake and briefly smelling marijuana smoke to be shameful and highly troubling. Due to how much he values education and intelligence, he often fails to recognize that others do not share his enthusiasm. He also fails to understand the extent to which his school can be unhelpful to his students, and often expresses total naivety to fairly obvious things (for example, the fact that Mayor Quimby is corrupt, or that Bart stole his car keys to prevent his skipping town).
 Skinner fighting In moments of extreme incense, Skinner displays uncharacteristic backbone, even towards Agnes and Chalmers. For example, against his mother's wishes, he proposed to Edna Krabappel a woman that Agnes speaks hated due to choosing to not allow her to control him any longer. When he was finally tired of Chalmers yelling at him, Skinner stood up to his boss by claiming that he should try teaching Bart Simpson instead. After this outburst of confidence, he proceeds to call the furbishing company for Springfield Elementary to demand that he didn't want a carpet for the halls but his bravado was quenched when he was asked to hold on the phone. And when a group of lawyers tries to punish him for using a Disney trademark in a school event, he attacks them using methods which he learned in the army.
 In addition, under extreme circumstances, Skinner when left extremely incensed can even drive him to borderline murderous actions. An especially notable instance of this was during the Sun Blocker incident, where he proceeded to duck out of the town hall meeting and intended to ambush Mr. Burns when he left. However, he was unable to actually do so because he took his mother's makeup by mistake (he was actually going for camouflage paint), with Superintendent Chalmers stumbling upon this just as Mr. Burns got shot. He also implied that he did dark stuff to Principal Kahoutek and his kid when they beat him to the punch regarding reporting a discovery of a celestial body. However, he wasn't always like this. In fact when Skinner opened Springfield Elementary he was shown to be much more carefree and there was a pool on the school grounds but following a prank where the water was replaced with worms and he was trapped for two weeks turned him into the stern teacher which everyone knew.
 Whilst usually considered to be a ""square"" by his students and peers and it has been proven that he is, Skinner has shown to be a more complex and tortured soul due to his own tragic history. A Green Beret in the Vietnam War, Skinner was said to have been disgraced or betrayed by his country when he returned home and it was heavily implied that he suffered from some degree of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder because of his time in 'Nam. Amongst famous spectacles of his PTSD would be when he saw his war buddy, Johnny, gunned down when he was sending a Valentine's letter and screamed into the school intercom over this memory, making Bart believe that he ""broke his mind"" and the months he spent in a POW camp where his friend was eaten by an elephant. In these flashes, Skinner becomes dark and melancholy, if not comically but he is quickly able to shake this off. Once, while sharing a hotel room with Homer due to their participating in a jury relating to Freddy Quimby's assault on a waiter, he also ended up undergoing a PTSD nightmare of gunning down advancing Vietcong soldiers (presumably relating to the Tet Offensive due to his mentioning Walter Cronkite turning against them), with Homer awake and eating popcorn while cheering Skinner to fight back, implying that his PTSD nightmares were frequent.
 Even so, Skinner's square tendencies were also evident in 'Nam which implies he has always been, for want of a better term, ""unhip"" but became more rattled over his time there as a soldier. His guilt over accidentally inhaling marijuana smoke, the fact that stealing a cupcake from his commanding officer was his worst action and how he reminisced of candy bars in captivity then commanding his soldiers to do the same when they began thinking of women instead show these square tendencies in Skinner's personality.
 Skinner with permission slips More than anything, however, Skinner is prioritized by making sure that Springfield Elementary is well-funded, prioritizing it above the welfare of the schoolchildren within it. This behavior is displayed by the way he always asks for permission slips from the students parents before a field trip, simply to have them as merits so the school can't be sued if anything dangerous or fatal happens to them outside of the school, even when Uter was trampled and left behind on a Civil War, Skinner was only concerned that they had the permission slips from Uter's parents.
 Skinner is incredulously cheap with the quality of Springfield Elementary, among them the teachers who are underpaid and the books that are only banned from other schools. The old school bus is heavily dilapidated and worn-down, once exploding simply because a leaf touched it and Skinner once elaborated that the heavy chemical fumes were cause for the low test scores on some other students. Generally though, Skinner is unconcerned with the future of the children and the poor standards of the school, largely because he doubts the students have any future and he rides all of Springfield's promise on Lisa Simpson.
 When he did receive a large grant from a board of directors, instead of using it to better fix the school, spends it on a billboard and later on a liquor store. Despite this, he does ultimately love the concept of school, as in his debut appearance, he told Bart that there's ""learning afoot"" when trying to get him to class (either not aware or not caring that Nelson just threatened Bart with a fight at the school yard); and in Bart's Comet, he reacted with anguish when he learned that President Clinton declared that school was for losers on the headline, being far more in dismay over this than either Bart beating Skinner to the punch of a celestial object or even his accidental release of a vandalized weather balloon (which acted as the reason he had Bart present in the first place) he had just retrieved from learning of the aforementioned event.
 Skinner and Krabappel Despite Skinner's love for his job, he has had a few relationships in his own personal time. He became smitten with Patty Bouvier (although the feeling was hardly mutual) as Patty was forced into the relationship initially and seemed to abuse him a lot, although Skinner was happy to take it. He proposed but she was too dedicated to her sister to be in a marriage. Edna Krabappel was the longest of Skinner's relationships but she was frustrated of his doting on his mother and he did get cold feet on their wedding day which ended their union but he continued to have feelings for her nonetheless. Skinner had a passionate fling with the substitute music teacher, Calliope, but this reached a subsequent end after three months. Another thing to note is that despite Skinner often attending the First Springfield Christian Church, he was seen in a Jewish synagogue few times.
 Skinner drove several vehicles in several episodes. In newer episodes, he owned a Merkur, which has been mentioned in several newer episodes. In older episodes, he owned a Toyota Camry. He also owned a Volvo, which got destroyed by Bart and Milhouse.
 Aside from a short-lived relationship with Patty Bouvier, Skinner's love life focused on Edna Krabappel. The two dated for several years and became engaged, but later canceled the wedding. Edna left Skinner because he could not commit to her - namely by letting his mother, with whom he still lives, control him anymore. Skinner also developed a romantic relationship with the substitute music teacher, Calliope Juniper. However, after Bart had no interest in her daughter, Melody Juniper, she decided to leave and persuaded Skinner to come with her. Skinner left with Calliope and Melody, but came back a few months later with no known explanation..
 Skinner wears a cerulean business suit (purple in season 1), grey leather shoes, a rose petal pink tie, and a lavender dress-shirt. It is sometimes stated that he wears a toupee.
 He has yellow skin, short, straight, grey hair styled in a generic fashion, and a large nose. Unlike most Simpsons characters, he has a gap between his eyes.
 Skinner's backstory was revisited in the episode ""The Principal and the Pauper"", where it was revealed that Skinner is an impostor. Born Armin Tamzarian, it emerges that he was a troubled orphan until he was forced into the United States Army during the Vietnam War (although he also had other options such as jail, and apologizing to the woman he stole from and judge he accidentally struck while trying to escape; Skinner stated he would have chosen to apologize instead had he known there was a war going on at the time). There, he was befriended by Sgt. Seymour Skinner, who he came to idolize as the big brother he never had and made him believe there was more to life.
 This episode is assumed by some (who?) to be non-canon.
 When Sgt. Seymour Skinner was reported missing and presumed dead, Tamzarian returned to Springfield to tell Skinner's mother, but she deliberately mistook him for Seymour, despite believing she knew he wasn't really her son, Tamzarian assumed his former sergeant's identity and followed Skinner's dream of becoming a school principal. It is revealed that Skinner (AKA Armin Tamzarian) was born in New Orleans.
 The real Seymour Skinner had been alive after all, and briefly returned to Springfield to take his rightful place as Springfield Elementary School School Principal, but had proved hopelessly unpopular and the Springfielders ran him out of town on the railroad. Judge Snyder granted Tamzarian Skinner's ""name, and his past, present, future, and mother"", and decreed that no one will mention his true identity again ""under penalty of torture"" (however, Lisa calls him by his true name teasingly when he comments on her decision of calling Snowball V ""Snowball II"", without consequences), thus everything returned to normal.
 In the final segment of ""Treehouse of Horror III"", Skinner is of the many Springfield Citizens who turned into zombies.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror IV"", in the second segment Skinner rides on the school with the children due to his mother hiding his car keys as punishment for talking to a woman the phone. During the bus ride, Skinner eventually becomes annoyed with Bart telling people there is a gremlin on the outside the bus and forces Bart to sit next to Üter Zörker. He then finally gets rid of Bart by sending him to a mad house.
 In the final segment of ""Treehouse of Horror V"", he and most of Springfield Elementary School staff eat children after he finds that Jimbo Jones tastes delicious after Doris Freedman spills stew all over him. Causing all of the teachers to become monstrous cannibals as a result. This all turned out to be Bart's nightmare all along.
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror VII"", Skinner gives Bart the prize for winning the school science fair.
 In the first segment of ""Treehouse of Horror VIII"", Skinner is one of the people who survived the nuclear explosion but is turned into a horrifying mutant as a result.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XII"", Skinner, as Wizard Skinner, presents many magical performances done by the students of Springwarts Elementary School. Including Lisa Simpson.
 In Treehouse of Horror XIII's parody of Dr. Moreau, he was turned a baby joey with his mother as a kangaroo.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XIV"", Skinner's skeletal system is ripped out by the regenerated body of Professor Frink's father.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XX"", Skinner was killed by Bart.
 Skinner killed by Bart In the opening of ""Treehouse of Horror XXIV"", he is seen running from Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Wolfman, the Mummy, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, the Bride of Frankenstein, the Metaluna Mutant, and the Invisible Man. In the second segment, Skinner is unable to start his car, he gets out of the car when he cannot do it and cries on the ground.
 In ""Lisa's Wedding"", he receives an invitation to Lisa's wedding.
 In ""Future-Drama"", Skinner is the principal of Springfield High School.
 In Holidays of Future Passed, Skinner becomes a landlord of The Lofts at Springfield Elementary, a housing block which the school has become, with Bart as one of the tenants. He also tells Bart that he is two weeks late on his rent along with a geography report from thirty years ago.
 In ""Days of Future Future"", Skinner is seen with the skeleton of Agnes Skinner at a restaurant.
 In ""Flanders' Ladder"", Skinner dies at age 119 from a heart attack after Bart launches fireworks into the air saying that ""Skinner sucks"".
 Skinner acts as a passenger in the game. If the driver is Bart, a conversation will occur where Bart stammers upon noticing that his passenger is Skinner due to thinking he is in trouble due to technically cutting school, although Skinner mentions that he has no intention of punishing Bart this time around and implies he himself is also ""playing hookie"" regarding school before requesting him to drive him to a specific destination. In some cases, he'll request the player to take him to Edna's apartment while slyly claiming that he intended to finish grading homework with her at that location, indirectly alluding to the then-occurring romance between Skinner and Krabappel.
 In The Simpsons: Hit and Run, Homer delivers Lisa her school project, because she has forgotten it. He drives quicker than Skinner to the school. The next day Skinner chases Bart on his car after he skips school. His mother can be seen sitting in the back seat. Later, he confiscates a laser gun from Bart due to his having it in his possession technically violating the gun free zone rules for the school, despite Bart protesting that he actually needed the gun to prove an evil plot was occuring, and Bart has to destroy his car to get it back. He also asks Lisa for help with some errands, and makes little secret of how overjoyed he is that Bart disappeared. Although Skinner himself doesn't make a physical appearance in Marge's level, he was alluded to in the bonus mission, as he had locked up Comic Book Guy's gifts to his mother inside the school grounds for reasons implied to be due to wanting to keep the two apart. Occasionally when driving his car, whenever his car is damaged, he'll sometimes yell ""Fire in the hole!"", alluding to his military background (""Fire in the hole"" is a term utilized by soldiers warning their fellow soldiers that an explosion within confined quarters will occur, usually one of their own making).
 In the second level of the game, Skinner's revealed to have hired Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney to steal stuff from the museum--he claims that he did it because the school's science budget was cut back so much that he had to steal stuff from the museum just to be able to have visual aid. He's ultimately stopped by Homer and Bart and arrested by Chief Wiggum.
 He also takes part of an angry mob led by Marge and Lisa in the fifth level, where he's found near the museum.
 When walking around Springfield between levels, Skinner's always seen inside of Springfield Elementary.
 In the first skit, Skinner and Clancy Wiggum move to New Orleans to combat a newcomer gangster known as ""Big Daddy"".
 Skinner, like Homer Simpson and a few other residents of Springfield, has displayed inhuman or unusual skills. He once tracked Bart throughout Springfield with no visible trail and even walked along the bottom of a river to cross it and then climbed a cliff. He also fought with Bart on a bus and went through a concrete bridge completely unharmed.
 Skinner is normally quite passive and submissive outside of school. As a former green beret and war veteran, he occasionally demonstrates he is capable of action in spite of his cowardly demeanor. For instance, he once casually took down the Blue-Haired Lawyer and his two giant bodyguards.
 Skinner is also highly intelligent. He is a member of the Springfield chapter of Mensa, meaning that his IQ is at least 130 and is at least in the top 2% of the nation. Other than his membership, however, he does not display extreme intelligence but rather seems like an ordinary man constantly irritated by Bart.
 Skinner was also a talented, founding member of the Be Sharps Barbershop quartet.
 Skinner's first appearance Principal Skinner first appeared in ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"", which was also the first Simpsons episode to air. Matt Groening based him on ""all the principals of  youth, rolled into one bland lump."" Writer Jon Vitti named him after behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner. Skinner was originally supposed to wear a toupee, but it was dropped because the writers didn't like ""that type of joke"". The Simpsons Guide to Springfield as well as one of the Blackboard gags did, however, briefly imply that Skinner did wear a toupee. In the newer episodes it is confirmed that he wears one.
 In the first few seasons, Skinner resembles Norman Bates, the main character from Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho. In later episodes, Skinner's behavior was based on teachers that Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein had in high school.
 Superintendent Chalmers was introduced in the episode ""Whacking Day"" as a boss for Skinner and Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria, the voice of Chalmers, fell right into the characters and quite often ad-lib between them.

Waylon Smithers,True,True,False,False,True,1,Shearer,43,"Smithers (by Mr. Burns)Chuckles (by Larry Burns)Mr. Smithers Waylon Joseph Smithers, Jr., better known as Mr. Smithers, Waylon Smithers or simply Smithers, (born December 25) is a recurring character on The Simpsons. He is also a minor character in The Simpsons Movie. 
 Smithers is Mr. Charles Montgomery Burns's deeply devoted personal assistant, executive, and self-proclaimed best friend. Although, in Lisa The Skeptic, it is first majorly shown that Smithers has deep feelings for Mr. Burns, kissing him on the mouth near the end of the episode. Burns, however, rarely views Smithers as worth any sort of genuine warmth or care, and much of the humorous dynamic between the two characters comes from this tension. Early on in the series, it was established that Smithers has a powerful crush on Burns.
 Smithers is the highest-profile gay character on the series; he officially came out in the episode ""The Burns Cage"", although most people in Springfield (and fans of the show) were well aware before this. 
 Smithers is generally portrayed as a nerd, someone awkward, uptight, and fragile. He is allergic to bee stings and has hypothyroidism, both of which can kill him. He is also lactose-intolerant. He has Springfield's largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls.
 Smithers is the definition of neutral. He definitely doesn't agree with Burns' actions, but he's in love with Burns and will do anything for Burns to like him. However, sometimes he's been hit hard such as in Season 6 Final episode ""Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)"" where Burns says he'll block out the sun, or in the episode ""Flaming Moe"" where Burns says Smithers means nothing to him. 
 Smithers was once shown to be a baby when Homer Simpson was 12 years old, while in other episodes he was in grade school and high school at the same time as Homer. It's possible that the corpse of Waylon Smithers, Sr., who died when his son was 4 months old, was never found for at least 12 years, but if that were the case and reality were to apply, the corpse would be much more decayed than it appeared to be, and possibly nothing but dust, as Waylon Sr. died of radiation poisoning, which causes corpses to decay faster than normal.
 His life was also on a floating timeline. He once said he was born 25 years after the 1929 stock market crash, in 1954, yet in a flashback, he was in high school in 1999. This may be partly because the show itself is on a floating timeline, with the characters continuously staying the same age despite time marching on as usual.
 When Smithers was a baby, his real father, Waylon Smithers, Sr., was Burns' assistant until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown. Smithers never learned the true cause of his father's heroic death until Mr. Burns ended up telling the truth to the Simpsons family years later, with Burns instead claiming Smithers Sr. was killed by Amazonian warrior women (whether or not this played a role in his sexual orientation as was hinted in the scene remained unknown). Smithers wore glasses even as a baby. In grade school, he was a target for bullies (including Homer Simpson). He was the announcer for the high school gymnastics competition, giving particular emphasis on the male gymnasts over the female gymnasts. Eventually, he became Burns' personal assistant.
 Smithers confronts John As a (not very well) closeted gay man, Smithers has had a crush on Burns for as long as he has worked for him, but Burns is almost always oblivious. Smithers was once married to a woman, but it fell apart when she wanted to have sex with him, and also referred to Mr. Burns as ""awful"". At one point it was implied that Smithers was linked romantically to John, the owner of Cockamamie's thrift shop. After coming out he later dated Julio, although Smithers' continuing feelings for Mr. Burns interfered with their relationship. Aside from his heavily implied homosexuality, Smithers was also implied to have at least some gender confusion and transvestite tendencies, as, when smoking weed to allow Homer to not violate his vow of never smoking it again, Smithers ended up cross-dressing as Judy Garland and suggesting that Homer pose as Mickey Rooney of 60 Minutes fame until Homer's reference to where Mickey Rooney came from had him realize that Mr. Burns (who had earlier left to take a bath after sweating) had been gone for over an hour, and his asking for bottles of estrogen from Marge during a drug sale claiming it was for ""a friend trapped in the body of another friend"" (which is implied to be his way of avoiding directly stating that he wanted them for himself), and also his asking Kim Basinger for a copy of the red pumps that she used in LA Confidential, which was implied to be so he could use them to dress up as her.
 Smithers with his dolls Smithers collects Malibu Stacy dolls, was implied to be a frequent attendee of the StacyCon at San Diego, writes a newsletter about the doll, and was the author of a Malibu Stacy stage musical that played in New Mexico; he played Stacy's boyfriend. In the episode ""Lisa the Skeptic"", when the people of Springfield believe that an apocalypse is upon them, Smithers takes the opportunity to show Mr. Burns how he feels and kisses him. However, when it becomes apparent the ""apocalypse"" was just a hoax, Burns still remains oblivious to Smithers' feelings, while Smithers covered up his actions by claiming it was a sign of respect. He also came close to coming out to Mr. Burns during the Do What You Feel Day festivities in the episode ""Bart's Inner Child"", though he quickly covered himself by claiming he meant that he loved the Hawaiian shirt Mr. Burns was wearing at that time, and then privately lamented that he should have come out to Mr. Burns in the boat house earlier. Despite his crush on Mr. Burns and several times coming close to coming out, he also was shown to be horrified when someone implies they know his sexual orientation, as evidenced by the episode ""The Springfield Files"", when Mr. Burns, when asking Smithers what he was doing on the weekend, he said ""something gay, no doubt"", causing Smithers to stammer and be taken aback by the question until Mr. Burns revealed he meant the antiquated definition of gay that meant doing something fun or happy (apparently being unaware of the definition change to be a euphemism for homosexuality), with Smithers then laughing nervously after confirming Mr. Burns' question.
 He once owned a Yorkshire Terrier named Hercules. When Mr. Burns convinced Sideshow Bob to run for mayor, it was Smithers who revealed to Bart and Lisa a clue that would lead them to the truth about Bob's not-so-honest victory in the mayoral election, hinting that his reasons were due to Sideshow Bob planning on enacting policies that were oppressive to his orientation. He intended to supply them with the information anonymously, although his efforts were spoiled by Homer driving up and then activating his headlights.
 Younger Smithers. In 1995, when Burns tried to steal oil from Springfield Elementary, although Smithers nominally had Mr. Burns' back, he secretly was disgusted with what Mr. Burns was doing, even going as far as to, after surveying the closure/damages to the Springfield Retirement Castle, Moe's Tavern and Springfield Elementary as a result of his slant drilling operation, sarcastically ""congratulate"" Mr. Burns for wiping out his ""enemies"" in thinly veiled contempt, and when Mr. Burns attempted to block the sun from Springfield after stealing oil from the elementary school, Smithers objected and was fired. This droves him into a nightmare of alcohol abuse and Comedy Central viewing. He was the main suspect in the subsequent shooting of Mr. Burns, but he was cleared due to it becoming obvious that, as he had been watching Pardon My Zinger at the time of the shooting, he couldn't have been the one who did it. However, he did, in a drunken stupor, shoot Jasper in his wooden leg while trying to rush home to watch his favorite TV show. No charges were pressed in this case, mostly because Jasper already forgot about it. After Burns is shot, Smithers goes to church where he admits to God he isn’t a Catholic, although he did try to march in the Saint Patrick's Day Parade. Chief Wiggum was listening due to it being a police trap and arrested Smithers, who was later exonerated. He also went behind his boss' back earlier, although a lot more reluctantly, regarding Sideshow Bob as aforementioned. Similarly, after Mr. Burns rejected Smithers' feelings for him despite the latter coming out to him, Smithers quit on Mr. Burns and, due to having come up with the traps in Mr. Burns' office in the first place, also outwitted Mr. Burns by not only dodging all the trap doors Mr. Burns placed in his floor, but also manipulated him into dropping himself.
 In ""Midnight Rx"", Burns cancels his employees' prescription medication plan. After a while, Smithers' thyroid starts to swell because he can't afford his medication. Burns accompanies Homer to Canada in his airplane in order to get Smithers's medicine before he passes on.
 Smithers' official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant, which he says is ""actually about 2,800 smaller jobs"", responsible for monitoring employee attendance, is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of ""Employee of the Month"" awards. He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive vice president, but Burns has repeatedly squashed this dream, while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on Homer and a dog.
 He was once, however, made the CEO of the Nuclear Power Plant in Burns' stead when Mr. Burns was arrested for stealing paintings from an art museum, a position that is arguably better than vice president, although he hints that he didn't want the job. He initially tried to be an employee-friendly boss, but after overhearing a conversation between Lenny, Carl, and Homer while meeting at Moe's Tavern that revealed that they were abusing his employee-friendly nature to in essence goof off, he became a worse CEO than Mr. Burns (even going as far as to release wolverines in the house instead of hounds). He eventually gave up on the position willingly after Burns was released by Lenny, Carl, and Homer.
 Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in the World and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club. As such, he also implies that he is a regular attendee at the annual StacyCon at San Diego in Airport Hilton with his statement of ""Hello, Malibu Stacy Fans. I'll be seeing you at StacyCon '94 at San Diego Airport Hilton.""
 It was implied once that something laid eggs in Smithers' brain and was considered serious enough of a medical issue that Mr. Burns, who had himself been discharged from the Mayo Clinic with a clean bill of health (relatively speaking) apologized to Smithers about his news, with Smithers himself stating that, since he considered the mere fact that even one egg was laid in his brain was ""too many,"" he would ""prefer not knowing"" how many eggs were in his brain.
 Aside from his suspected shooting of Mr. Burns, as well as any acts he did on Burns' behalf, he also did a very bad thing in a park during the night at one time while Chief Wiggum had been on patrol, although the latter did not arrest him during this time. Wiggum later alluded to this incident when Smithers was unable to wear a hat despite one of the old laws mandating that he wear a hat during the day time, citing that if he didn't arrest him for ""that night in the park"", he certainly wouldn't have arrested him for what was implied to be a misdemeanor by comparison.
 Although he is the sidekick of one of the biggest villains on the show, Smithers has a relatively friendly relationship with the Simpson family. He gets along well with Lisa as well as willingly aided her in tracking down Stacey Lovell, and is good friends with Marge, with whom he has a lot in common. As for Homer, there is usually tension when the two interact (likely due to Homer having bullied him), though after Homer unintentionally knocked Mr. Burns out of a three story office onto the parking deck in an earlier fight with Smithers, the latter proceeded to send a gift fruit basket to Homer and the rest of the Simpson family in gratitude since it allowed Smithers to be re-hired by Mr. Burns (Smithers had earlier been fired in a backfired attempt at ensuring he didn't get upstaged as Burns' assistant due to his pick, Homer, being so terrible at his job that Burns was forced to become self-reliant).
 Smithers acted as the main antagonist of The Simpsons Arcade Game by Konami, where he abducted Maggie (due to her taking a diamond that he had stolen during a heist at a jewelry store). After a prolonged chase (including initially losing his quarry in the mountains before retrieving her via a hot air balloon), Smithers proceeded to fight them in Mr. Burns's office, using various bombs. After being defeated, he reveals lots of bombs in his coat, only to express shock when they are lit, exploding and presumably killing him, or at the very least severely injuring him. Mr. Burns, who had been watching the entire fight from a painting and who had orchestrated the heist (and by extension, the kidnapping), then proceeded to personally deal with them in a mecha, although he was soundly defeated.
 Smithers was responsible for ensuring the art contest on The Krusty the Clown Show was rigged in Bart's favor as part of Burns' murderous vendetta against the Simpson family, and also reminded him that he wanted the Simpsons wiped off the face of the Earth. He was also tasked with contacting each family relative of Mr. Burns for the various locations in the tour, and also cutting ties with each of his family members (in particular, crossing Abomnible Snow Burns from the Christmas card list and writing Ramses Burns out of his will, in particular being bequeathed his salad bowl). He later proceeded to arrive with Mr. Burns when the latter was forced to arrive on the show to personally congratulate Bart, and got pelted with cream pies alongside his boss.
 Smithers doesn't actually have any speaking roles, although he does appear in the opening scene where he is at City Hall near the speech podium as Mr. Burns gives his speech unveiling the Nuclear Powered Megabuses. He is also seen during game play where he acts as the driver for Burns' limo.
 Smithers appears in the first level, where Homer has to deal with him twice. The first time, he was to oversee an inspection at Sector 7G, Homer's workplace, for a worker evaluation. Homer ended up destroying his car via the Plow King (which he borrowed from Barney). He later ended up driving away when Homer tried to find Mr. Burns, with Homer needing to race him to Burns Manor so he could extract a confession from Mr. Burns regarding the emergence of mysterious satellite vans. However, upon Homer learning they were actually pizza vans and Burns had absolutely nothing to do with the vans at all, Smithers was ordered by Burns to release the hounds on him, and presumably fire him in the event Homer had been one of his employees.
 He later appears as the bonus level character for the final level, ""Flaming Tires."" Homer begs for his help regarding the ""frightening, odd, godless fascinating stuff"" that is occurring in town, but Smithers declines as he has to do errands for Mr. Burns, even though those errands were occurring the same time as a brunch date with someone (Smithers implies that this was typical). Homer then proceeds to aid him in finding various items for Burns. The first being Alan Porterhouse's keep-em-up Sock Garters (Mr. Burns' favorite brand), which Burns needed due to his socks pulling at his ankles for several days. He then tasks him with finding ""Dr. Wunderstein's Tooth Powder"" (which Mr. Burns needs despite not actually having teeth anymore due to it making him feel young again when rubbed against his gums, with Smithers implying he only does it because he loves Mr. Burns and not because he enjoys the activity, to Homer's disgust). After that, he then tasks Homer with finding the vinyl record ""Yes, We Have No Bananas"" (according to Smithers, Burns needs it to bolo the exercise every morning, specifically to ensure his muscles don't fall off the bone). Unlike other characters, Smithers does not actually state he'll help Homer via a call, though they nonetheless unlock ""his"" vehicle, Mr. Burns' limo.
 He appears in the ending of ""Lisa the Tree Hugger"", where he drives Mr. Burns' limo and apologizes for the loss of the woodcutting industry, and also proceeds to phone some of Burns' goons to beat up Al Gore to make him feel better.
 Smithers appears during the Mob Rules level, where he is one of the members ""recruited"" into Marge's mob protest against Grand Theft Scratchy: Blood Island throughout the level. It is heavily implied that he only participated in the mob because he thought it was meant to be a mob trying to bring about gay marriage, or at least something in honor of Mr. Burns.
 He, or at least sailors modeled in his likeness, were also prevalent in the final mission for the Medal of Homer level as enemies. According to Sergeant Abe Simpson, the Smithers sailors that act as the crew for the U.S.S. Reel Crazy aircraft carrier served ""neither god nor country -- they fight for love"". Similar to the main timeline Smithers, the sailors had a fanatical amount of loyalty to Private Burns, as he gave an order to ""defend our fearless leader"" as well as declaring for Homer and Bart's surrender and ""Mr. Burns for ever!"" Some of Homer and Bart's dialogue indicated that one of the sailors was in fact Smithers' grandpa. Unlike his implied grandson, however, it is heavily implied that these Smithers sailors were not homosexual, as Bart when interacting with them will sometimes yell ""Your grandson's lifestyle will sicken you."" The World War II Smithers make a final appearance in the Game Over level as one of the icons God uses to defeat the Simpsons as the family destroy his Praystation.
 Smithers is unlocked at the Executive Lackey Pt. 2 Quest, once you place down the Burns’ Manor building, you will unlock “Smithers.”
 Smithers kisses Mr. Burns. Smithers frequents Springfield's gay section. He is arrested for trying to obtain opium for Mr. Burns while in Morocco. Burns says to Homer ""I've never seen someone take to a Turkish prison so quickly."" Smithers once went on vacation to a male-only resort. He is passionate about Mr. Burns and has at least occasional fantasies about the older man. In one, Burns appears flying through Smithers' bedroom window, or jumping out of a birthday cake and singing ""Happy birthday, Mr. Smithers"". When Smithers powers up his computer, the screensaver is clearly a de facto nude Mr. Burns saying ""Hello Smithers. You're quite good at turning me on.""
 On one occasion, Smithers is forced to go to Dr. Nick's ""no questions asked clinic"", having apparently put something in his butt which was now stuck there. Smithers has declared his love for Burns on some occasions, such as kissing Mr. Burns on the lips after saying ""Oh, what the hell!"", believing the world was ending, later explaining it to him as ""merely a sign of my respect"". Smithers once said; ""I think women and seamen (semen) don't mix"".
 Smithers in the gay neighborhood Burns himself has been involved with several women, much to Smithers' frustration, such as Marge Simpson's mother, Jacqueline Bouvier, Marge herself, and Gloria. He was disgusted by strippers who danced in front of him in a strip club and was noticeably disgusted when Burns started looking for a female companion. Burns, for his part, views (and refers to) Smithers as a lackey, albeit a highly valued one for his competence and toadying. He has ""rewarded"" Smithers' devotion with the future ""honor"" of being buried alive with him after he dies. Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns, like the occasion when Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers chooses that he needs to be Burns' assistant and eventually gets his job back. For all his sycophantic devotion to Mr. Burns, Smithers has been willing to challenge him on some occasions. When he opposed his employer's various evil schemes, Burns fired him. As a result of his firing, Smithers became a ""hideous drunken wreck"" and when Mr. Burns was shot later, Smithers thought he might have done it while he was drunk. When it was proven that he had not, Smithers seemingly forgave Burns and demanded that the culprit be brought to justice, offering a reward for the capture of the perpetrator. A lesser demonstration of this challenging him was when he aided the Simpson children in giving a vital clue towards how Sideshow Bob won the mayoral race, with his reasoning  behind this being implied to be disagreement with Sideshow Bob about restricting those of his ""sexual lifestyle.""
 In Squeam, Smithers plans to ditch his own ""gay ways"", and is the main guy who dresses up like ghost face along with Lovejoy every 15 seconds. It reveals he loves Fox shows and hates that they got canceled and kills Lovejoy by accident. He is later killed by the real killer and falls on Lovejoy as if kissing.
 As seen on Professor Frink's future machine, eight years from the present, Smithers has to inject himself with some concoction every 10 minutes with a syringe to be heterosexual (upon taking the injection he waves his arms in the air and shouts ""I loves boobies!""). In one possible future, 15 years from the present, he thawed out Mr. Burns and had his seventeen stab wounds to the back cured. He attended Lisa Simpson's wedding with him. In the year 1,000,000 AD, Smithers's head is on a robotic dog body and follows Mr. Burns's head everywhere.
 Smithers appears in The Simpsons Arcade Game as the first boss of the final level, as well as one of the main antagonists. Smithers, presumably under Mr. Burns' command, broke into a jewelry store to steal a diamond. As he and his fellow henchmen were making their escape, he (quite literally) bumped into the Simpsons family, causing him to lose the diamond, and for Maggie to catch it. Due to this setback, Smithers ends up kidnapping Maggie, and, after a few misadventures, he makes it back to the Nuclear Power Plant, although not without the Simpsons family following him. He then fights the family, remarking ""Welcome to my world!"" He lobbed several explosives at the family. When sensing that he would soon lose, he opened his cape, revealed to be filled with explosives, cackling maniacally only to react in shock as he discovers that the explosives had activated, causing him to be caught in the explosions. For unknown reasons, Smithers in this game actually sounds much higher pitched than in the regular series (most of the other characters usually have more or less the same voices in the game).
 In The Simpsons Game, level ""Lisa the Tree Hugger"", Smithers was involved in Mr. Burns's plan of trying to cut down the entirety of Springfield Forest, and is comforting him about doing better next time when the plan fails due to Lisa and Bart's interference, as well as phoning some goons to beat up Al Gore. In Mob Rules, he appears as one of the people Marge can use to protest the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy video-game to minors, although it's implied that he had a different aim in mind for doing the mob protest, including trying to celebrate gays. In Medal of Homer, a squad of sailors resembling Smithers protects Private Burns on board his personal naval carrier where he protects the stolen paintings from the village of St. Capitulons. According to Abe Simpson during the briefing for the level, the sailors in question fight neither for country nor for God, solely for love.
 Smithers with black skin and blue hair, as seen in ""Homer's Odyssey"" Waylon Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers's orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads. The script for ""Blood Feud"" originally featured Smithers saying ""Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids,"" but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers.
 Smithers made his first appearance in ""Homer's Odyssey,"" which was the third episode of the first season, although he can be heard over a speaker in The Simpsons series premiere ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"". In his first visual appearance in ""Homer's Odyssey"", Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made darker than most characters by Gyorgyi Peluce, the color stylist. In a 2014 interview, the show's creator Matt Groening claimed that the character was always meant to be yellow, but animators painted him the wrong color and, because they were low on funds, they could not afford a retake. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be ""Mr. Burns's white sycophant,"" and the staff thought it ""would be a bad idea to have a black sub-subservient character"" and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. The first appearance of yellow Smithers was ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"", the fourth episode of the first season.
 Smithers dreams about Mr. Burns in ""Marge Gets a Job."" The censors had issues with the ""lump in his bed."" Smithers's relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running joke on The Simpsons. Smithers is an obedient and sycophant assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers's true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode ""The Telltale Head"". Smithers's sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a ""Burns-sexual"" and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is obviously gay. During the Bill Oakley/Josh Weinstein era, they still tried to keep his sexuality difficult to pigeon-hole. There was debate among the writers about his orientation. Al Jean, who thinks of Smithers as being a ""Burns-sexual"", felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay. David Silverman, a former supervising director has said, "" seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to anything beyond that. , he's sort of 'Burns-sexual'"".
 ""Waylon Smithers"" is actually an anagram of ""Wants him sorely"". In a 2006 study conducted by the ""Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation"", it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian. Smithers was not included among these nine characters, and it caused a mild online controversy. Patty Bouvier, Marge Simpson's lesbian sister, was included on the list. The debate is referenced in ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"", when the episode host, Troy McClure is answering viewer questions, and one that is asked is ""What is the real deal with Mr. Burns's assistant Smithers? You know what I'm talking about."" A montage of various clips that shows Smithers's lust for Mr. Burns follows, and in the end, McClure says ""as you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns's assistant. He's in his early forties, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for asking!""
 Several of the allusions to Smithers's sexuality have turned into battles with the censors. For example, in Smithers's fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in ""Rosebud"", the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is ""Marge Gets a Job"", which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally it went on for a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed ""Mr. Burns landing on a particular position on Smithers's anatomy"". There were also issues with ""the lump in his bed"", which the animators had been drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted. He also dressed up as a drag queen once.
 In the early seasons, Smithers has an occasional catchphrase, which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer is. In some scenes, Smithers and Burns would watch Homer over a security camera Burns will ask, ""Who is that man?"", to which Smithers would reply, ""That's Homer Simpson, sir, one of your  from sector 7G.""
 In the second season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns's relationship, and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition.
 In 2004, Simpsons producers announced that one of the characters was going to come out of the closet. Speculation on who it would be was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada (even claiming Smithers's ""sexual orientation was about the worst-kept secret in Springfield,"") as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, (the Irish Independent called Smithers ""too obvious"" a choice) and the United Kingdom. Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, The Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on ""cartoon gaydar"" who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers. Jenny Stewart, the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll, ""We've never had such an avalanche of people voting in any of our polls as we did on The Simpsons."" After the guessing, it was Patty Bouvier who came out.
 It was first hinted that Smithers was, or is looking into becoming, transgender when Marge was selling prescription medication at a garage sale, and he bought bottles of estrogen for ""a friend...who's trapped in the body of another friend.""
 He also hints at transgender tendencies in ""When You Dish Upon a Star"" when he asks Kim Basinger where to get red pumps similar to those her character wears in LA Confidential, and also in ""Weekend at Burnsie's"" where Smithers, while stoned from smoking a joint of marijuana in order to allow Homer to keep his vow of not using marijuana after quitting it, proceeded to dress up as Judy Garland and suggested that Homer dress up as Mickey Rooney before realizing after Homer noted that the latter was of 60 Minutes fame that Mr. Burns had been gone for over an hour, far too long regarding his bath.
 Although not a true hint, the end credits for ""Dial ""N"" for Nerder"" had among the ""cast"" Smithers dressed up in drag as the ""wife"" of Mr. Burns. (However, these may simply be because drag is relatively common in Springfield's gay community.)
 In ""Frink Gets Testy"", when Jonathan Frink searches for Bart's file, Smithers’ file is seen for a brief moment, saying ""soon to be Wanda.""
 In a 2007 article, Entertainment Weekly named Smithers the sixteenth greatest sidekick of all time. They have also described Smithers and Mr. Burns as being ""TV's most functional dysfunctional couple"". Star News Online named ""Smithers's fey way"" as one of the four hundred reasons why they loved The Simpsons. In a 2003 article, Entertainment Weekly named the Who Shot Mr. Burns? duo of episodes, in which Smithers was prominently featured, 25th best episode.
 Smithers was made into an action figure, and four different versions were included as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first shows Smithers in his normal attire with a picture of Mr. Burns at his feet and was released in 2000 as part of ""wave two"". The second, released in 2002 as part of ""wave ten"", is called ""resort Smithers"" and shows him dressed as he was at the resort in the episode ""Homer the Smithers"".
 In 2003, a series of figures exclusive to Electronics Boutique was released, and a set of one Mr. Burns figure and two different Smithers toys based on the episode ""Rosebud"" were included. One, called ""Bobo Smithers"" shows Smithers dressed as Mr. Burns's teddy bear Bobo; and the other, known as ""future Smithers"", shows him as a robotic dog. A ""Future Burns"" was included in the set as a companion to ""Future Smithers"" and depicts Burns as how he appeared as a robot at the end of the episode.

Simpson family's first pet cat


First Appearance
""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"" (first mentioned)""Bart Gets Hit by a Car"" (first appearance)


 Snowball I was the Simpsons' first cat who died before the start of the series. She is mentioned occasionally and sometimes seen in flashbacks. 
 Snowball I was first mentioned in ""Simpsons Roasting On an Open Fire"", in a family Christmas letter Marge is writing. She explains that Snowball I had died that year, but they got a new cat to replace her, Snowball II. This episode was not the first produced, and the Simpsons are depicted as having a pet cat in both ""Moaning Lisa"" and ""The Telltale Head"" which were produced earlier. It's unclear if the cat seen in these episodes is supposed to be Snowball I, or if Snowball I's death happened sometime before Season I began, but the latter seems likely, given the cat seen in the two pre-Christmas episodes is black, not white. Based on a memorial photograph we see of her in Lisa's room in one episode, Snowball I was five years old when she died. 
 Snowball I is usually portrayed having green eyes and white fur, hence her name. The humor of Snowball II's name comes from the fact that unlike Snowball I, she is a black cat. However, in one episode Snowball I is depicted as being black too (see image on the right).
 White Snowball I According to Lisa in one of her poems, Snowball I was run over by a Chrysler, as mentioned by Homer in ""'Round Springfield"". She later claimed Snowball I was run over by Clovis Quimby, the drunkard brother of Mayor Quimby.
 Snowball I's burial spot has not been consistent. Sometimes she is depicted as being buried in the Springfield Pet Cemetery,  located next to Antonio's Ice Palace. In one episode, however, she is buried in the Simpsons' backyard, next to their various other dead cats.
  Snowball I in Heaven Black Snowball I's portrait Snowball frozen Snowball is a rare example of a character who predates the show's on-screen continuity, along with Marge's late father. She is only mentioned in dialogue or occasionally seen in flashbacks.
 In one episode, Ms. Albright tells Lisa that Snowball I cannot go to Heaven because it is just for humans. This is later proven false in ""Bart Gets Hit By a Car"" when Bart sees an angel version of Snowball I (complete with tire tracks) during his near-death experience.
 Sideshow Bob used Snowball I's name (along with those of many other dead people and animals) to pad the voter rolls and get elected mayor of Springfield in 'Sideshow Bob Roberts"". This angered Lisa much more than Bob's repeated attempts to kill Bart.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror III"", Bart and Lisa try to bring back Snowball I using a zombie spell in the pet cemetery, but instead awaken an army of human zombies in the nearby Springfield Cemetery.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XIV"" segment ""Reaper Madness"" Homer claims that he killed the Grim Reaper as revenge for killing Snowball I and John F. Kennedy.
 Many Simpsons books are jokingly dedicated to her. For example, in The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family (in which she is mistakenly colored black), the dedication reads, ""We hope that they change your cat box in kitty heaven more often than we did down here.""
 In The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror: Fun-Filled Frightfest, published by HarperCollins in 2003, the more morbid dedication reads ""We're sorry you're gone. You would have made a tasty hors d’œuvre."" Also, in The Simpsons Holiday Humdinger, it reads, ""As this snow sculpture thaws on the first warm day, so will our hearts melt whenever we think of you.""
 
A passage in Cartooning With the Simpsons reads, ""Dedicated to the memory of Snowball I: You may be gone, but we still remember how to draw you."" Many other Simpsons books are dedicated to her, but the dedications ceased in 2005.

Moe Szyslak,True,False,False,False,False,1,Azaria,45,"Moammar Morris ""Moe"" Szyslak (pronounced /ˈsɪzlæk/ or ""siz-lack""), also known as Moe the Bartender is the proprietor and bartender of ""Moe's Tavern"", a Springfield bar frequented by Homer and his friends. He has once stated that he moved to Springfield from the Netherlands. He also owns Moe's Bagels in Colorado and Moe's Express in the Food Court area of the Springfield Mall. 
 Moe is portrayed as often irritable and rude to all except his bar friends Homer, Lenny, Carl, and Barney. His easy-to-lose harsh temper usually turns down women and finding a girlfriend for Moe has therefore been a running joke, from indulged sexual abstinence to unsuccessful suicide attempts to dating generally rejected women. However, Moe has a soft side as well, and has been seen helping others in need. This includes saving marooned school children, giving food to a famished village, and saving people from a rampaging flood.
 He is sometimes shown in a love pyramid with Homer, Marge, Ned, and himself.
 Moe either illegally immigrated to the United States or was born in Indiana. He mentioned being Dutch. He used to have an Italian accent, hinting at Italian heritage, though a police background check run by Homer reveals his real first name to be Moammar. In ""Lisa Goes Gaga"", Moe said that he was ""Half monster, half Armenian."" It is further referenced in the episode ""Moe Goes from Rags to Riches"" that his father is the yeti that lives on Mt. Everest. In a more recent episode, Moe states that his birth was the result of a ""Voodoo Curse"" that had been placed on his mother that after five years of gestation he popped out backwards and on fire. However, he has a New York accent and Szyslak is a Polish surname. It is revealed in the episode ""King Leer"" that Moe had a strained relationship with his father as a result of his past, in which his father ran a series of mattress stores along with him, his sister and brother against a rival competition chain. The strain resulted when he was asked to put bed bugs on the rival's mattress' but refused to go through with it after seeing a picture of the rival chain owners family, only for the rival to go through with putting bedbugs on his father's mattress store, thus closing a series of stores and creating the distant strained relationship with his father and siblings.
 Moe's Tavern As a child, he played the part of ""Smelly"", a tough kid, on The Little Rascals until he killed Alfalfa (or rather, an orphan portraying as him) in a fit of rage for stealing his bit and was fired. For a while, he suffered from ring-worm claiming ""For a while, I was a little more worm than kid."" His first kiss was at age 10 with Comic Book Guy. At some unspecified time during his childhood, his parents dropped him off at summer camp, never to return, leaving Camp See-a-Tree as the closest he could call a home. Moe becomes a victim of prank calls when young Marge calls the boys's camp and requests ""Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar"", Homer's alias. An angry Moe hangs up, turns to the camera and says, ""And, uh, that's the origin of that"". Moe has stolen many things, perhaps most prominently a bag of gold Aztec coins from a young, aspiring Snake, turning the latter to a life of crime. As a young man, Moe became a professional boxer, going by the names ""Kid Gorgeous"", ""Kid Presentable"", ""Kid Gruesome"", and ""Kid Moe"". Moe blames his boxing career for making him ugly, despite in ""Them, Robot"", a child Moe has a normal face, but then an elephant steps on him turning his face to the way it is today. According to Moe, his boxing career ended because of politics, and because he was knocked out 40 times in a row. Moe's ugliness got him rejected for a role on the soap opera ""It Never Ends"". Later plastic surgery nailed him the role before his face was damaged to its original appearance. His current appearance has been described as consisting of ""cauliflower ear, lizard lips, little rat eyes, caveman brow and fish snout"". After attending bar-tending school at Swigmore University (a play on Swarthmore College), Moe opened his own drinking establishment, although often operating on expired, out-of-state, or forged liquor licenses. As an aside, it was revealed that Moe started a cult. He also dabbled in Satanism, but was asked to leave.
 Moe discovered a knack for judging competitions (rather harshly), leading him to a place on American Idol. After a spat with Simon Cowell, he was banned from judging and the state of California. In a previous episode he said he does many activities but judging isn't one of them. During Trappuccino, he claimed he was the emperor of Springfield.
 Moe answers a prank call from Bart Simpson. Moe is characterized by a short, violent temper (particularly aiming a makeshift shotgun at customers), a somewhat low self esteem coupled with homicidal and suicidal tendencies and a proclivity towards obsessive behaviors. He has an annual Christmas tradition of attempted suicide, but his attempts are comically unsuccessful (landing on a hot-air balloon after jumping out of a plane, for example). He has called the suicide hotline so many times that they have blocked his number. Although he has a violent temper and homicidal tendencies, there were instances where even he did not approve of violent depictions. This was most especially evident when he saw the Mel Gibson-starring remake Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, where he flatly said ""Well, that was disgusting!"" while leaving the theater with the rest of the sickened audience regarding the infamous killing spree ending. 
 Moe's Tavern on St. Patrick's Day Moe is especially bitter, keeping an enemies list nearly identical to that of Richard Nixon, with the addition of Barney (the latter simply because he pointed out that it was plagiarized from Nixon's list). He has assumed a leading role in many of Springfield's angry mobs (including, at times, starting mob riots for the sake of doing so), and kidnapping Talking Heads vocalist David Byrne. He has also engaged in bizarre behavior, such as shooting at Carl, robbing Homer of expensive pants, keeping Hans Moleman under his bars in a subterranean torture chamber, perpetrating insurance fraud, and stalking various townspeople. This behavior is further exhibited when he becomes the self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield when the town is trapped in a dome. His leadership is challenged by Barney who throws a Molotov Cocktail at him, which Moe successfully throws back. He once implies that he probably wouldn't continue to be suicidal if Reverend Lovejoy had told him that he had much to live for.
 He also was shown to be notoriously cheap to his customers, as he drove away designated drivers from his bar on Saint Patrick's Day claiming he has ""no time for cheapskates"" due to it being the biggest drinking day of the year, and once told Homer when giving him a beer while the latter was awaiting quadruple heart surgery that it wasn't a free beer. In fact, one of the few times he DID give anyone, let alone Homer, a free beer, was when he was intimidated by Homer's Zorro-esque actions regarding challenging someone to a duel after thwarting an attack at a movie theater he saw a Zorro film at.
 Moe and Colette Moe has a strained love life due to his vulgar attitude, especially towards women. Nevertheless, Moe has had a number of romantic experiences, including sleeping with his waitress Colette, dating a woman named Renee, and enjoying the company of many women after he had plastic surgery to correct his ugly appearance. According to ""The Fight Before Christmas"", Moe was in a relationship with singer/songwriter Katy Perry as she was 'into puppets'.
 He has long been infatuated with Homer's wife Marge (whom he often refers to as Midge) and has on occasion professed his love for her and tried to win her away from Homer. His infatuation with Marge was intense enough to enter stalker territory, where he apparently bugged the Simpsons home to overhear Marge (unaware that he himself was being monitored by the FBI for this, which according to them, each of his statements would ""add another year to the slammer"" (presumably referring to what Moe's prison sentence length would be if he were to be caught and brought to charge for it).
 Moe in the line to register as a sex offender Moe's romantic attractions have resulted in criminal behavior and run-ins with the law; he has stalked Maude Flanders and other townspeople, he must register as a sex offender, and has had a restraining order placed upon him. Regarding his sex offender status, he also once told Brockman when asked if he is a registered voter that he was a ""registered... something"" before shifting his eyes. His sexual offenses have led him to take on the ""nickname"" ""Hey, you behind the bushes"". At one point he is seen on his way to a ""V.D. clinic"". He openly admitted to Ned Flanders that he would have chosen to engage in sexual intercourse with Ned's late wife if Ned had died instead. Moe has also proposed marriage to a WNBA mascot, even knowing that the character inside the mascot is Gil Gunderson. He dated a woman named Maya whom he met on the internet and is shocked when she turns out to be a little person. He is initially afraid to introduce her to people and he proposes eventually. She almost accepts but he keeps making inappropriate jokes about her height. He even went as far as to arrange a surgical procedure so that he was the same height as Maya, but he never went ahead with the operation.. However, a long time after their breakup, they reunited in a traffic jam, where Maya was still in love with Moe and wanted to get back together, to which Moe agrees and eventually proposes to her again, which Maya happily agrees this time and they became engaged .He also dated Mrs. Muntz. Likely due to his perversion as well as frequent lack of ability to make connections with real women, Moe has also frequently satisfied his sexual desires with pornography as well as images of women in the Sears Catalog. Moe also met a supposedly Russian woman named Anastasia Alekova, who was a mail wife which Bart ordered for him as a prank, and Moe fell in love with her but refused to get romantically involved with her after his previous heartbreaks, but after she leaves with Krusty, Moe decides to marry her, however at their wedding, Moe discovers that Anastasia is an American con artist who only wanted to take his assets, so Moe angrily cancels the wedding. 
 Despite his faults, Moe often expresses genuine love and sentimentality, suggesting that he may not be as gruff as he appears. He has a cat named Mr. Snookums, of whom he is very fond. Moe is also kind towards the rats that live in his bar. On Wednesday nights, he reads to the homeless in a local soup kitchen and he also reads to sick children at the hospital. Until it was destroyed, Moe had a fondness for a jar of pickled eggs. He saved the owner of King Toot's music store and his wife from a flaming car. Moe has expressed distaste of cruelty towards animals. He saved the life of Maggie Simpson (ironically at a time that he was about to jump from a bridge) and took efforts to protect her. Moe engaged in charity work in South America or Africa, using a flying fan to fight forest fires and deliver medical supplies to people devastated by floods. Moe has knowledge of automobiles and dancing. Also, in the middle of the baseball game, he ran naked on a field in front of everyone to help Bart and gain another try for him to catch a ball.
 Moe streaking at a baseball game. When Moe noticed that Homer, Apu and Timothy Lovejoy had relationship problems with their wives, Moe fake-threatened to run away with one of them, in hopes that the men would appreciate their wives. It is also implied in the same event that he had gotten into enough trouble with saying several things that were worded in a way that sounded worse than intended to have to neurotically state it's not what he meant, as when calling Apu about one of his kids being left at the bar, he ended up having to repeatedly make very clear after relaying the message on Apu's voice mail that it was not a kidnapping ransom or kidnapping threat. He is also rumored to have rescued the Springfield Elementary Model U.N. Club that was stranded on an island, but exactly how he did it is unknown.
Moe has been implied to be an illegal immigrant at least twice in the series. When asked to listen to his inner child at a self-help seminar hosted by Brad Goodman, a younger Moe appears, telling older Moe, ""what's-a matter, Moe? You no longer speak in your accent no more"" in an Italian accent and to this realization Moe proclaims ""mamma mia!"" in his accent. The second time was during Proposition 24 where Moe takes a citizenship test but wearing a false mustache. Another implication to Moe's foreign descent is when Homer does a background check on his character and calls him Momar which causes him to become embarrassed. However, this probably cannot be trusted as early in the season he is referred to as ""Morris"" by his bartender Colette.
 Moe seems to follow some kind of organised religious cult and/or satanic practices. He has shown to dabble with voodoo such as stabbing a miniature rag doll of Barney with a beer bottle to get him to drink again (which can only be assumed how Moe gets all of his customers). He also practices Santeria, an Afro-Caribbean religion based on Yoruba beliefs and customs. When Barney decided to go sober but ultimately returned to his bar, Moe silently thanked a shrine underneath his counter with a picture of Barney and a skull, claiming ""Santeria, you're the greatest'. Aside from this he was a former Movementarian but left the cult when their religion was exposed as a fake and once claimed to worship a dog's bad dreams to his bowling team. He also at some point believes that a snake-handling church is the true faith; in ""Pray Anything"", when he asks Elijah Hooper which of the true faiths he belongs to, he answers Hooper with ""That's the wrong thing to say to a snake handler!"" He also claimed to be a devoted snake handler in ""Homer the Heretic"". At one point Moe started his own cult, where he is the god. He claims to have done this to get out of court and so he pretended to be crazy. Kearney and his family were members of this cult until Moe revealed it to be fake.
 Moe's personal letter logo. Moe is the owner and, except for a few instances where temporary help is hired, the only employee of Moe's Tavern. His most loyal customer is Barney Gumble, with other regulars including Homer Simpson, Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Sam and Larry. Moe is notoriously cheap with his customers, refusing to give them free drinks, or throwing them out when they are out of money (and in one case, calling designated drivers ""cheapskates"")). He encourages his customers to drink as much as possible to grow their tab. Barney's tab had to be calculated by NASA; the total came to $14 billion. Moe removed games from the bar, noting that ""people drink less when they're having fun"".
 Moe generally serves Duff beer on tap, having little knowledge of liquors or wines; the liquor bottles visible behind the bar are said to be ""painted on,"" and in one instance, he unknowingly sells an expensive 1888 bottle of Château Latour for a few dollars. He enthusiastically abandons his bar, its regular customers, and his friends when a better opportunity comes along, such as the drink ""The Flaming Moe"", the opening of his postmodern bar ""M"", and the conversion of his bar into a family-themed restaurant called Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag.
 Moe is often engaged in shady or illegal activities at his tavern, including smuggling pandas and orcas, hosting Russian roulette games, operating an unlicensed casino, serving liquor without a license (his expired in 1973 and it is only good in Rhode Island as well as being signed by Moe himself), running a speakeasy during Springfield's brief flirtation with Prohibition, and performing unlicensed surgery. While Moe and his bar have gained occasional popularity, the phenomenon tends to be short-lived.
 
Moe is also part of ""The Guys"". Moe as judge in American Idol In ""The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"", Moe has his own spin-off, ""The Love-Matic Grampa"", in which Abraham Simpson dies and his spirit falls into Moe's Love-Matic tester machine, and proceeds to give Moe dating advice to woo a woman named Betty. They both go out on a date, but Moe must visit the bathroom each time to see Grampa, until she discovers his plan. She forgives him for his efforts.
 In the Simpsons/Family Guy crossover Bart shows Stewie how to prank Moe and Stewie tells him that his sister is being raped. Later, Moe tells Peter that the Pawtucket Patriot is base on fraud when he reveals it is actually Duff Beer.
 Players can play as Moe in this game. Moe drives a green sedan with a peace flower from the 1960's painted on the hood of the vehicle. Moe is also an NPC and can be driven to destinations in the game (such as the Construction Site, Inspiration Point, and Skinner's House).
 Moe's House in The Simpsons Road Rage. Notice the Panda crates in front of his driveway! Moe is an NPC in the game who appears in his Bar in the Downtown levels, he has several spoken roles both as part of quests and player interactivity. His Sedan with the Rubber Daisy is an unlock-able car by completing races in one level.
 Moe is Homer's coach in the level ""Around the World in 80 Bites"", and when he wins, Homer bites off Moe's hand by accident. He is one of the people Marge can recruit in ""Mob Rules"" to protest the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy video game to minors (in the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions, he is found in the back-alley near the Town Square, while in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, he is being detained by riot cops in the car park with Cletus Spuckler). Moe saw Lard Lad attacking the Downtown area and emailed Comic Book Guy about it. In NeverQuest, the Orc-Moes resemble Moe.
 Moe with his shotgun Moe's character was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis ""Red"" Deutsch, who was made famous in the popular Tube Bar prank calls when he was repeatedly prank called by two Jersey City residents. These calls were the inspiration for Bart's repeated prank calls to Moe, and Deutsch's often profane responses made Moe's violent side. Moe's further inspiration was drawn from comedian Rich Hall, an acquaintance of The Simpsons writer George Meyer. Hall considered being the basis for Moe ""an honor"". Moe's surname ""Szyslak"" was revealed in ""Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)"", the writers found the name in a phone book and gave it to Moe so that he would have the initials M.S., and hence could be a suspect in the Burns shooting. He was designed by Dan Haskett.
 Moe was originally voiced by actor Christopher Collins in the episodes ""The Telltale Head"" and ""Some Enchanted Evening."" He was soon replaced by Hank Azaria because Sam Simon found Collins ""difficult to work with."" Additionally, Christopher Collins died on June 12, 1994. In a 2018 interview with GQ, Hank Azaria commented on replacing Christopher Collins as Moe, saying that he did not find out until many years later that he had replaced another actor. Azaria said that when he asked why he had replaced Collins, he was told by Matt Groening, ""He (Collins) was great... He was just a dick. His voice was great, he was just kind of jerky to everyone."" Azaria continued, ""Think about how awful—that guy could have been on The Simpsons his whole life. Lesson to you kids: Always be nice!"" Moe was the first voice Hank Azaria performed for the show. At the time of his audition, Azaria was doing a play in which he had the part of a drug dealer, basing his voice on Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. He used the same voice in the audition, and was told by Matt Groening and Sam Simon to make it more gravelly, with it becoming the voice of Moe. Groening and Simon thought it was perfect and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe. Also, in Season 1, he was seen with black hair instead of his current gray hair, which he had since Season 2. After ""When Flanders Failed"", when Ned Flanders opened the Leftorium, it is revealed that Moe is left handed. During ""Bart-Mangled Banner"", Moe claims to be Dutch, only to stomp out of his bar wearing clogs a few seconds later.
 In ""Flaming Moe's"", his hired waitress Colette calls him ""Morris"". In ""The Springfield Connection"", Homer told his friends that he was enjoying background of whoever he wanted. Homer then referred to Moe as ""Moammar"" and Moe cringes with humiliation. It is implied in ""Eeny Teeny Maya, Moe"" that he changed his name to Moe so he could keep the sign and the bar's name.

Milhouse Van Houten,True,False,False,False,True,1,Hayden,46,"Silly Milly Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a major character in The Simpsons and a minor character in The Simpsons Movie. He is a ten year old boy and Bart Simpson's best friend since first grade and kindergarten class. As the only child of Kirk and Luann Van Houten, Milhouse's most distinctive physical traits are his blue hair, big nose and extreme nearsightedness (depicted by very small eyes), requiring thick glasses to correct. Being eyed as a nerd, he has regular intelligence but somewhat poor social skills. Although devious in his own way, Milhouse is quite gullible, which is why he is often led into trouble by Bart, who is not shy about taking advantage of the other's naïveté. Milhouse serves as the school president of the Springfield Elementary from 2004 to 2005.
 When Milhouse gets irritated at Bart, he says ""I'm only three months younger than you"". Bart was born on either February 23 April 1, so that means Milhouse was born in May to July (most likely May 23 or July 1, since he doesn't mention how many days younger he is than Bart). 
 Even though he is usually much better liked and tolerated compared to more genuine nerds such as Martin Prince, Milhouse is constantly victimized in one form or another, mostly as a target of the bullies Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam, and Kearney Zzyzwicz. They often inflict extreme acts of physical violence upon him. One instance had the bullies wrapping Milhouse in bumper stickers and placing him in a shopping cart, which they pushed down a very steep hill. He frequently visited a female counselor, Dr. Waxler, until even she got fed up by his constant phone calls, and blocked his number from her own phone. The feeling was apparently mutual, as while attending a radio show, he ""plays"" in the cockpit of an F-22 and ""aims"" at his parents in what is implied to be revenge for forcing him to see a psychiatrist. He is also frequently subjected to Nelson Muntz's bullying, including Nelson Muntz's ""stop (hitting, zapping, etc.) yourself."" 
 Milhouse was seen as relatively cool in only two episodes. When his parents were lost at sea and presumed deceased, the kids at the school were impressed by Milhouse's stoicism, even Nelson, who refrains from beating him up. Bart brought Milhouse's uncle Norbert (who is of Danish descent and resides in Solvang, California) to Springfield to console Milhouse. When Milhouse's mother moved with him to Capital City after his parents separated, in another episode, he dyed his hair blond, wore fashionable clothes and acted rude to impress his new friends, who acted similarly. He even asked Bart to let him give him a wedgie to impress the others. After his father Kirk won custody of Milhouse and brought him back to Springfield, everything went back to normal.
 Milhouse in a ""bad boy"" appearance. People frequently make Milhouse the butt of a variety of jokes and abuse, ranging from being beaten up by Nelson and his cronies to having the door slammed in his face while playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey to being hit in the mouth by an errant hockey puck causing him to lose most of his teeth to being named a wanted fugitive on America's Most Wanted due to Bart's Internet mischief. Milhouse also unknowingly inherited Bart's abysmal permanent school record through a side deal arranged between Bart, Edna Krabappel and Principal Seymour Skinner in order to buy the former's silence about the latter two's illicit relationship, which will disqualify Milhouse from ""all but the hottest and noisiest jobs"". He also almost walked straight into a cactus at Bart's ""directions"" during a birthday party with Martin, although he ended up not doing so due to his coming down with food poisoning from tainted oysters just as he was about to do so, thus forcing him run over to the moon bounce and vomit in it, to the occupants horror and disgust. He also ended up injured by Mr. Burns via a broken leg specifically to motivate the Springfield football team into winning against Shelbyville, with Milhouse also ominously stating that if the team didn't win, Mr. Burns says that he's ""coming back"" (presumably to do even worse to Milhouse). Despite the frequent abuse and misfortune, Milhouse is not particularly disliked and has a decent amount of friends at Springfield Elementary aside from Bart, although most such people usually seem mutual through Bart himself.
 It is heavily implied that Milhouse is nearsighted without his glasses. At one time, Bart used his glasses as makeshift binoculars to spy on Lisa and her new friends, and when leaving to sabotage the friendship proceeded to take the glasses with him to Milhouse's protests, with Milhouse then proceeding to mistake a horseshoe crab for a dog. Similarly, after Bart, while acting as a faith healer, proceeded to ""cure"" Milhouse of his needing glasses, proceeded to walk out onto the street and then mistook an oncoming car for a dog and promptly got run over. Once, when fighting Bart, he briefly removed his glasses, only to quickly put them back on with the implication that he needed them to see.
 Milhouse is of Greek, Italian, Dutch and Danish descent. His mother, Luann Van Houten (née Mussolini), is Italian, although Milhouse never speaks Italian when he spent his days with his grandmother Nana Sophie or is seen with Nana Sophie Mussolini. In Italy, while spending his days with Nana Sophie and accidentally speaking English, he was whipped by his maternal grandmother who angrily believes that her grandson is talking English instead of Italian.
 Milhouse is nearsighted and wears red glasses. He has yellow skin (like most Caucasians in the series), straight blue hair and wears a light purple T-shirt, red shorts, and matching red shoes. He also has a noticeably large nose and is noted for being among the few characters with eyebrows. He inherits much of his physical traits from Kirk Van Houten, so much that in Hardly Kirk-ing, Milhouse mimics his father due to Bart tightening his vocal chords.
 Milhouse and Bart in kindergarten. Bart and Milhouse share a general friendship through the series. Milhouse first became friends with Bart in kindergarten when he sat next to him while drinking milk. After Bart makes him laugh and squirt milk out of his nose by making fart noises, Milhouse thinks that is funny, forming their friendship (and encouraging Bart's mischief).
 Milhouse's toy horse On one occasion, Bart got Milhouse placed on the America's Most Wanted list and on another occasion, he tried to lure Milhouse into a cactus. This kind of torture is often used by Bart, who tries either to get Milhouse in trouble or to hurt him for no reason, making the relationship of Milhouse and Bart even more questionable. Bart once introduced Milhouse to Greta and attempted to explain why they are friends. He is unable to come up with a real answer and admits that it is due to geographical reasons. Homer enjoys occasionally making fun of Milhouse (i.e. referring to him as ""that little wiener Milhouse""). Milhouse sometimes does bad things due to Bart's influence, such as dropping mustard on cars from the top of a bridge and destroying the school by loosening all the screws, which is why Milhouse's mother once decided that she didn't want the duo to see each other anymore but later she had changed her mind after Marge told her that the two are each other's ""only"" friends.
 Milhouse tattles on Bart in church. Milhouse as Fall Out boy in Tapped Out On the other hand, Milhouse's loyalty to Bart as a friend is arguable. Through the series, Milhouse has been shown to be occasionally fickle and disloyal towards Bart, as he often abandons him, sells him out to avoid trouble, or attacks him whenever a dispute breaks out. Such instances would include (but are not limited to): 
 Milhouse with Bart Based on the evidence of their relationship as friends, the general thing holding their friendship together appears to be geographical convenience and a mutual interest in pranks, Krusty the Clown, and Radioactive Man comics.
 Anytime that Bart insist that they should do something, Milhouse would opt out and give an excuse that his mother won't let him. A few examples are, ""My mom"":
 Milhouse dressed up in a woman's clothes. Milhouse is clumsy around females. He also exhibits a tendency to begin acting rather ridiculously feminine, complete with cliched catchphrases and mannerisms. This case of social anxiety has lost him Lisa's heart three times, as well as a relationship with Rainier Wolfcastle's daughter Greta. Examples of such behavior are referring to himself as a ""big sister"" and being caught with a scrunchie in his hair.. Once, Milhouse rides Lisa's bike, and Bart asks him what it's like riding a girl's bike, and Milhouse replies ""it's surprisingly comfortable"".
 Milhouse and Samantha's final kiss. Milhouse's first girlfriend was Samantha Stankey, a new student who had moved to Springfield from Arizona. Because of all the time the two were spending together, Bart felt excluded and resorted to revealing their relationship to Samantha's strict father, who caught her and Milhouse in the treehouse. He sent her to a Catholic girls school in Quebec so she would never see Milhouse again. After visiting her at school and sharing one last kiss, Samantha broke away from Milhouse.
 Milhouse accidentally kissed Homer. Note: Milhouse's official first kiss was with Samantha, this is contradicted when Milhouse claims his first kiss was actually with Homer when Milhouse's eyes were closed during a game of spin the bottle that Homer interrupted by unexpectedly going up the treehouse.
 Despite caring a great deal about Samantha early in the series, Milhouse harbors a hopeless crush on Bart's younger sister, Lisa throughout the series, even going so far as to make awkward attempts to impress her. His feelings are unrequited but Lisa is rarely cruel. She showed concern for Milhouse when he was beaten up by Nelson on one occasion and tended to him. This rare moment of affection however was brief, as she became distracted by the arrival of Irish environmentalist Colin, who became her love interest. When the Trappuccino finished, Milhouse lied to Lisa about Colin's demise and that he begged Milhouse to look after her. Colin returned in the midst of Milhouse's story, and he quickly took his leave. In a newer episode, Lisa kisses Milhouse on Holding Hands Peak, causing Milhouse to fall off the peak. He comes up on an eagle saying ""everything's coming up Milhouse!""
 In Moonshine River, he and Lisa dance, but Lisa says it was only a mindless friend date while Milhouse said it was a real date. He was once seen making out with Paris Texan, who is nearly 20, but this may be because he was wearing cool clothes at that moment.
 Milhouse may have a crush on Marge, implied when Bart asked him if he's in love with her. Additionally, upon being asked whether he thinks that Marge is cool, he immediately, without thinking, responds, ""No, I think she's HOT!""
 Milhouse also went out with Taffy although it ended when Lisa came between them.
 When Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel were dating and did not want Bart to tell anybody, they made a deal to change transfer permanent record and switch them with those of someone else. Bart agreed and Milhouse was given Bart's very poor permanent record. Milhouse once attempted unsuccessfully to destroy his new dismal school record, but failed when the record fixed itself, proving its permanence.
 Milhouse is fluent in Italian due to visiting his grandmother Nana Sophie in Tuscany for two weeks every year. Due to his grandmother's hatred of the English language because her American lover had abandoned her (she named their love child ""Bastardo""), whenever Milhouse spoke English she beat him. Thus, he learned Italian.
 In The Last Barfighter it is revealed that Milhouse speaks Spanish as well. 
 Milhouse is allergic to honey, wheat, dairy, non-dairy and even his own tears. In spite of his dairy allergy, he is often seen drinking it. He is also allergic to holly, mistletoe, the red part of candy canes and nectarine.
 He has demonstrated that he is a skilled Vespa rider, although he is obviously not old enough to legally operate a scooter on public roads. He came closest to wooing Lisa when he taught her Italian, as she even kept a picture of Milhouse in her room while practicing the language. It is implied that she was captivated by his impressive command of the language during a rather romantic outing to the local Italian restaurant. However, he once again reached a roadblock due to his ongoing fatal flaw when it came to girls.
 Milhouse knows how to cook. In the season 9 episode ""The Cartridge Family"", Homer asks if he knows how to cook dinner, and Milhouse responds ""Do I!?"" and starts gathering cooking supplies.
 Milhouse in the future. Milhouse began bodybuilding in juvie after he took the fall for breaking street lamps and was sentenced two years there when he was 12. After saving her from a fire that he had caused when Lisa was 12 years old, they finally began dating as a couple in High School; however, Lisa broke up with Milhouse shortly after graduation before going off to a private college in the eastern United States. After that, Milhouse attended MIT and graduated with a degree in Nuclear Engineering.
 Soon after graduating, he took a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, becoming the new Head of the Nuclear Safety Inspection Department for the plant, making him the superior of Homer. By then, Milhouse had embraced the early male pattern baldness he had hereditarily developed (and successfully hidden via comb-over) in high school. When Homer tells Milhouse of Lisa's marriage, he recalls their last date, and writes Homer's evaluation angrily.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", Milhouse finally marries Lisa and they have a daughter, Zia, and he is again in his hay fever period. He is retired, and no longer is a supervisor. 
 In ""Days of Future Future"", a zombie bit Milhouse, and subsequently Milhouse became a member of the living dead. This change rendered Milhouse more actively protective of and caring for his friends and family, which helped improve his marriage to Lisa.
 In ""The Boys Of Bummer"", a 70-year old Milhouse (possibly a clone since he is not a zombie), lets it slip to a 70-year old Bart that their little league game was faked to make up for Bart’s complete lack of athletic skill. The ghosts of Homer and Marge watch Bart taunt Milhouse.
 He appears in the game The Simpsons: Hit and Run. He has a fairly minor role at the beginning of Level 2, where he warns Bart that Skinner is after anyone who is skipping school that day and going to expel anyone caught by him.
 He also appears in Level 3's second mission, where he, despite not knowing where Bart (who by that point had gone missing) is, he guessed that he might be at Wall-E Weasel's, Planet Hype, and possibly the Springfield Sign (although it's heavily implied that he lied about Bart being there in an attempt to trick Lisa into going into a date with him at those locations). Eventually, Lisa got annoyed with him and bluntly told him that it's not a good time to hang out with him, causing him to break down.
 Aside from the above, he also appears in all the levels save for the seventh level of The Simpsons: Hit and Run as one of the judges for the Springfield DMV's street races, always being the first judge (he and the other judges are absent in level 7 due to their being replaced by Zombies). Milhouse explains that Selma and Patty forced him to take the job due to the fact that they won't allow him to get a license to ride a bicycle without training wheels otherwise, and was prevalent enough that he rescheduled a 4:00 wedgie with Nelson (who ironically was also one of the judges for the street races), as he later revealed to Bart. He also claimed that he gets a green cookie for Saint Patrick's Day (implying he has to continue working until at least that point), though it came out of his paycheck, which he told Lisa when she expressed surprised that he was working. Eventually, he settled down with the job even though he was exhausted, largely because the money he gets allows his dad to pay for his alimony.
 When Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph go to rob the Museum they stop by the Kwik E Mart and take Milhouse's pants by force. Milhouse later buys the New Grand Theft Scratchy Game by Cashing his dad's welfare Check and later roams around the streets with the other Kids who stop anyone who gets in their way and is stopped by Marge and Lisa. When the Simpsons Meet Will Wright Bart says he makes Milhouse look cool. When they get to the Game engine Bart says he can't wait to show the place to Milhouse. Milhouse appears as the villain Mr. Dirt who taunts Homer and Lisa as they seek to defeat all three Sparklemons. After they capture all three Sparklemon balls and place them in the coin slots of the giant toilet shrine, Mr. Sparkle cleans up the village, and Milhouse shrinks to normal, handing over the key card and being attacked by the three Sparklemon. When the Simpsons go to the Creator and meet his goons Bart says their just Milhouse in a suit. Milhouse later hates Marge for banning Grand Theft Scratchy.
 In the second segment ""Treehouse of Horror IV"", Milhouse freaks out of Bart being paranoid and goes to sit next to a German exchange student called Üter Zörker.
 In the final segment ""Treehouse of Horror V"", Milhouse falls into the food processor, killing him.
 In the second segment ""Treehouse of Horror XXIV"", Milhouse is taken to the hospital for severe pollen allergies.
 In the first segment ""Treehouse of Horror XXV"", Milhouse believes the rumours about the naked lunch lady.
 In the first segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XXVI"", Sideshow Bob to attract him to the music room to accomplish his lifelong dream: kill Bart. In the third segment, Milhouse gains superpowers after exposure to radioactive Goo.
 In the opening of ""Treehouse of Horror XXVIII"", he is a candy product named Nerds Box.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XXXI"" segment of Toy Gory when Milhouse tells Bart's toy that he is not treated will by and he has feeling as well the toys.
 Milhouse attempts to befriend the gelatin monster, but gets eaten instead.
 Milhouse is a caricature of Paul Pfeiffer from The Wonder Years. Milhouse was named after US President Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. The name was the most ""unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a child."" Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted ""most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart.""
 Other seeming inspirations to his design in consideration of the conception of The Simpsons may include the character archetype of the ""wacky and dorky"" best friend to the eldest son found in American family sitcoms of the 1980s, from Burt Weems from Valerie/The Hogan Family, Irwin ""Skippy"" Handelman from Family Ties, and  Richard Milhous ""Boner"" Stabone from Growing Pains.
 Milhouse was originally planned to be a character in Matt Groening's failed pitch for an NBC Saturday morning cartoon, Dante's Inferno. It was ultimately decided to re-use the character in The Simpsons, and tested him out in a Butterfinger commercial (as The Simpsons TV series was in the development stages at the time, with the family still appearing in sketches on The Tracey Ullman Show then).

Jacqueline Bouvier,False,False,False,True,False,1,Kavner,47,"Jacqueline Ingrid ""Jackie"" Bouvier (née Gurney), occasionally referred to as Mrs. Bouvier or Grandma Bouvier, is the mother of Selma, Patty, Marge, Arthur Bouvier and possibly Hortense, the daughter-in-law of Pepe and Bambi Bouvier (nee Petitbois), the sister-in-law of Chester, Jojo, Herman and Charlene Bouvier, the maternal grandmother of Bart, Hugo (non-canon), Lisa, Maggie Simpson and Ling Bouvier and the mother-in-law of Homer Simpson, and the widow of the late Clancy Bouvier. She also had a sister named Gladys who died of a bowel obstruction. A family tree showing Jacqueline's known family members can be seen here.
 Jacqueline used to live with her husband and their daughters in a house in Springfield, where she first met Homer when he pretended to be Marge's prom date. Nowadays, she lives in the Hal Roach Apartments but was also seen living in a house near a lake when her family visited her on her 80th birthday.
 Young Jacqueline Bouvier Jacqueline shares many Bouvier family traits with her daughters. During Marge's youth, Jacqueline looked virtually identical to her daughter as an adult, with a similar voice and blue beehaive hairstyle. However, Jacqueline also has traits in common with Patty and Selma, including a pessimistic and critical outlook on life and rarely smiling. She used to smoke as well. However, unlike Patty and Selma, Jacqueline seems to have stopped by now.
 Like most of Marge's relatives (including Patty and Selma), Jacqueline has a generally negative opinion of Homer, but, usually, she does not express it as much as Marge's sisters. She once told Marge that Homer would end up in a mental institution one day. She also told Homer never to call her ""mom"" again, although this may have meant she did not like the term, not necessarily that she did not like having Homer for a son-in-law. Jacqueline's attitude towards Homer seems to have softened over the years; she even stated that ""Patty and Selma are a sort of evil"" when they purposely provoked Homer one night.
 Jacqueline and Mr. Charles Montgomery Burns Jacqueline was married to Clancy Bouvier, who is now deceased. Jacqueline had a brief romance with Abraham Simpson, her son-in-law, Homer's father. However, she broke up with him when she was wooed by billionaire Charles Montgomery Burns, whom she nearly married before Abraham's intervention made her decide she was better off alone; Abraham was delighted nevertheless and said ""That's good enough for me!"". However, Abraham and Burns are still seen battling for Jacqueline's affections at times.
 Simpsons creator Matt Groening named Jacqueline after Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. She has the tallest hair of all Simpsons characters. According to a DVD commentary, her appearance was created by ""taking Marge's model and squashing it.""
 Most of Jacqueline's roles are brief, background appearances with little or no dialogue. The bold text indicates a larger role with a respective amount of dialogue.

Bleeding Gums Murphy,True,False,False,False,False,1,Richardson,48,"""Bleeding Gums"" or ""Oscar Gums"" Murphy Hibbert  (died April 30, 1995), was the idol and role model of Lisa Simpson. He first appeared in the sixth episode of Season 1, ""Moaning Lisa"".
 A young Bleeding Gums Murphy Bleeding Gums learned his musical skills at the feet of Blind Willie Witherspoon, who wanted to give Bleeding Gums his saxophone, only to be finally told that it wasn't a saxophone and actually an umbrella, meaning that Willie had actually been playing an umbrella for some thirty years. Bleeding Gums explained to Willie that no one informed him of the mistake because ""we all thought it was funny"".
 Bleeding Gums recorded only one album, titled Sax on the Beach, which was extremely lucrative for him. However, he soon went broke after spending too much of his money on several Fabergé eggs a day. He revealed that he had once made a guest appearance on The Cosby Show in 1986 as the Huxtable children's grandfather, as well as appearing on Steve Allen's Tonight Show.
 Murphy makes his first appearance playing his saxophone on a bridge in the middle of the night. This is a reference to Sonny Rollins, the great saxophonist, who famously retired from public and was not seen for three years, until a journalist discovered him playing the saxophone alone on the Williamsburg Bridge.
 Bleeding Gums was a mentor to Lisa Simpson until his early death. He played and vocalized a song written by Lisa. It pleased Lisa to see the performance of her own jazz song in the bar ""The Jazz Hole"", but not everyone in the family was happy with lyrics, as they criticized several of them (in particular, Homer was shocked and incensed by Lisa's claim that he belonged at a zoo).
 Bleeding Gums once sang a twenty six minute version of the American National anthem ""The Star Spangled Banner"" at the Springfield Isotopes game.
 He serves as one of the three judges for a talent show once, giving Bart a 10 for his impersonation of Principal Skinner. He also appears joining in with the song ""Sending Our Love Down the Well"" after Bart pretends that he fell into a well.
 Bleeding Gums' Gravestone He makes his final appearance in ""'Round Springfield"". When Bart ends up in the hospital after accidentally eating a jagged metal from his cereal, Lisa finds Bleeding Gums in a hospital bed in a nearby ward. They play Carole King's ""Jazzman"" together, entertaining the hospital. He explains about his life, family and work to her as well as giving her advice for her upcoming school performance, lending her his saxophone. When Lisa returns she is devastated when she finds out that Bleeding Gums has died from circumstances that are never revealed, possibly cardiac arrest.
Lisa is the only one to attend Murphy's funeral. Reverend Lovejoy gets his name wrong, calling him ""Blood and Guts Murphy"" and ""Bloody Gums Murphy"", as well as saying that he was ""quite the sousaphone player"". This prompts Lisa to buy his album, as the jazz station didn't have it, although she cannot afford it. Bart uses the $500 he got from his court case against ""Krusty O's"" to buy it for her. She gives it to the jazz station who play it on the radio. The signal isn't strong enough, but a lightning strike boosts the signal so that all of Springfield does hear it.
 Bleeding Gums (left) appearing to Lisa Simpson in a cloud, after his death in 'Round Springfield.' Murphy appears to Lisa from the clouds, thanking her for her final tribute before their final performance of ""Jazzman"".
 The appearance of Bleeding Gums Murphy is loosely based on Sonny Rollins, a great saxophone player who took a break from his life as a recording and performing jazz artist to practice his musical craft on a bridge. Bleeding Gums gave the origin of his nickname in ""Moaning Lisa"" as thus: ""Well, let me put it this way... you ever been to the dentist? Not me. I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is."" Bleeding Gums died in 1995 at the age of 59 after suffering an apparent heart attack.
 The voice of Bleeding Gums Murphy was provided by Ron Taylor, while his saxophone playing is provided by Dan Higgins. In the episode ""Dancin' Homer"" he was voiced by Daryl L. Coley.
Murphy has been a fixture of The Simpsons' opening sequence from Season Two on, even after his death. He even appeared in the live-action format, in The Simpsons Sky One commercial, that was also used for the episode ""Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife"". In 2009, the opening sequence had to be updated since the series was now broadcast in hi-def widescreen format. The new, updated sequence removed Murphy completely apart from a picture of him that can be seen in the Music Room when Lisa plays her Sax.
 Bleeding Gums Murphy with his Sax. In addition to his onscreen appearances, Murphy also appeared on The Simpsons Sing the Blues, an album of rock, and jazz music with vocals performed by characters from the show. On the track ""God Bless the Child"" (a cover of the Billie Holiday song), performed by Lisa Simpson (Yeardley Smith), Murphy speaks up after the final chorus to praise Lisa for her vocals, after which he and Lisa perform a saxophone duet for the remainder of the song. Murphy was again voiced by Ron Taylor for the song, and his alto saxophone part was performed by Kim Richmond.
 Bleeding Gums Murphy recently appeared in The Simpsons: Tapped Out during the Homerpalooza 2017 event as a premium limited time character that comes with The Jazz Hole.

Ling Bouvier,False,False,False,False,False,16,Cartwright,49,"Ling Bouvier (Mandarin:灵·鲍维尔) is the adoptive daughter of Selma Bouvier after she discovered that she had reached menopause in ""Goo Goo Gai Pan"".
 Ling currently lives with Selma, Patty and Jub-Jub.
 Selma adopted Ling in Beijing, China after discovering that she had reached menopause. She lied about being married to Homer Simpson, in order to fool the local authorities into thinking that Ling would be part of a traditional family as opposed to a single mother. Though she and Jacqueline Bouvier have only been seen once together, Jacqueline is her adopted grandmother. It's later revealed in ""Changing of the Guardian"" that Selma and Patty push her to her limit in numerous hobbies and fail to praise her. It's unknown who her biological parents are, nor is it known if they're alive or deceased. She also has diabetes, which she was more than likely born with.
 Ling has a weird habit of squeezing Homer's eyeballs, which he doesn't seem to mind, even though it would hurt.
 Ling was seen at the ""Midday Mommies"" with Maggie, Baby Gerald, Sashi Nahasapeemapetilon, and Noah's Sister. She also played with her cousin Maggie when Selma and Abe babysat.
 In her first appearance in ""Goo Goo Gai Pan"", she only made a few appearances making baby giggles and her only actual word in the series was ""mama"". During her other three appearances, she did not talk. She has a laugh similar to Selma.
 She appears slightly older by ""Changing of the Guardian"", walking, exhibiting manual dexterity, and even performing gymnastics. She also seems able to speak in complete sentences, saying ""Help me!"" to Marge.
 Note: All of Ling's major appearances are in bold.

Kent Brockman,True,True,False,False,True,1,Shearer,50,"Kent Brockman, once known as Kenny Brockelstein (born as Brock Kentman) is a local TV news 'personality' for Channel 6. He hosts the Channel 6 weekday news (Scott Christian is the weekend news anchor and Kent's fill-in) as well as Smartline, a local current affairs show, and also Eye on Springfield, which focuses mostly on Springfield's entertainment news. He also is a failed musician who toys with the idea of being a math teacher.  Channel 6 News Kent Brockman represents the worst of his profession: frequently judgmental; careerist to the point of absurdity; and more than willing to film and sensationalize a schmaltzy, emotion driven puff piece for the sake of a few extra ratings points. As with most Simpsons characters, Brockman's ethics and competence vary according to the needs of the episode. Largely due to his very loose ethical standards, he also had no qualms with lying about stories he was involved in. This eventually came to a head when he was exposed of not only lying about serving in Iraq under the 98th Airborne Squadron, but indeed that he had lied throughout his entire news career, which resulted in his firing as well as most of Springfield avoiding him due to losing trust in him to the extent of being visibly sickened by his presence. On a related note, he tends to devote some of his news reports to stuff that are more trivial than truly newsworthy, such as dedicating an entire night to the assassination of a squirrel resembling Abraham Lincoln over covering a boy trapped in a well, as well as interviewing Homer winning his 1,000,000th ice cream cone on Smartline over a debate over the Iraq War (although in the latter case, that wasn't actually Kent's fault, as the studio forced him to do the interview since the ice cream store in question Phineas Q. Butterfat's 5600 Flavors Ice Cream Parlor, was one of their sponsors, and he implies he was actually intending to do the Iraq debate and wasn't happy at this development). Also, he has conflicting personality traits. One minute, he claims to be a typical robust male who loves his steak and beer, and yet he also has claims to be a sci-fi geek who is a member of the Battlestar Galactica fanclub (the new one, not the old one). He has been seen throwing tantrums because he cannot find certain snack foods, and once blithely announced on-the-air that the boom operator on his news program was being fired the next morning (for which he took a clout on the head from the angry soon-to-be-ex-employee). He seems to command excessive levels of power within Channel 6, even having a segment of the news program to air his own (usually highly reactionary) opinions on current issues called My Two Cents. His comments and views on people with mental illness has also not gone down well, saying in online sports forums that he is on his ""two tablets a day and doing fine,"" which was meant as a put-down to people with such conditions. Despite all of this, he has won a string of media awards, but is most proud of his unspecified trophy from Del Monte. He was also a war correspondent during the Vietnam War, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, and the Gulf War (although, as he just says ""Iraq"", he could have been referring to the Iran-Iraq War). He also frequently uses Botox, having a saggy face without it, and is also balding rapidly.
 Kent's actual face Brockman has at least two daughters, one of whom was preteen, and the other was old enough for Arnie Pye to be making out with her behind Kent Brockman's back, and a preteen son, and has jealously mentioned his sister, who is a White House correspondent for CNN. Brockman owns a collie named Jessica, whom he had ""fixed"", and drives a blue Mercedes-Benz S420.
 It is suggested that Kent is an alcoholic, unsympathetic and not understanding of what some people have been through in their lives also can be a very resentful person when criticized, and tends to hold grudges against people who have wronged him in the past even though they have apologized for their actions, and apologies have been accepted by him, after he was seen present at Barney's A.A. meeting in Days of Wine and D'oh'ses.
 Brockman once won the multi-million-dollar ($130 million) state lottery jackpot and left the news desk while still on the air, but he remained a news anchor because he was under contract, though he also admitted that he likes making $500,000 a year. He also has an ongoing feud with traffic reporter Arnie Pye, and has been shown to criticize Pye's reporting; indeed, he once chuckled sadistically upon hearing the news that Pye had been killed in an accident. He mentioned to Pie that he made some smart investments when Arnie complained about the size of Brockman's house. It is also implied that Brockman was largely hated by his contemporaries at Channel 6, as the technical difficulty card for the station depicted Kent Brockman wearing a straitjacket and a cuckoo bird coming out of his forehead while laughing insanely, and Channel 6 News instantly took the opportunity to fire him twice regarding his blunders (once shortly after his demotion to weatherman regarding using foul language on the air , and the other time after he was exposed as a fraud).
 He is known for using news-speak in everyday language; for example, he shouts ""This just in: Go to hell!"" when he is booed by the crowd when he is revealed to be one of the celebrity judges in the ""Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out"" final match between Homer Simpson and Drederick Tatum. It was revealed that his 'wit' is provided by a microphone, ear piece and a communications team in a nearby van. He has been seen, more than once, stretching his face and removing wrinkles by clipping a clothes-pin to the back of his head. In addition to his news career, Brockman writes a column for PC Magazine called ""Making the Most of Your Modem."" Brockman is revealed to have a 'thing' for bondage. It is implied that he may be a heavy smoker, as he was seen smoking a cigarette and saying ""Oh God, I love to smoke"" afterwards (presumably on camera, given his reaction afterwards) before announcing his live broadcast of the opening day of the new Cosmic Wars movie: The Gathering Shadow. One time, he hired an accountant to take care of his taxes, but the accountant in question did not do the taxes until the last possible moment, a fact that Brockman did not realize until he was doing a live news broadcast on Tax Day.
 Kent rubbing his ear Brockman was known as Kenny Brockelstein early in his career, and he can be seen wearing the Hebrew Chai symbol as a gold medallion around his neck, suggesting Jewish ancestry. Interestingly, however, he also refers to the Book of Revelation, during an editorial in which he states women rebelling might lead to ""anarchy of Biblical proportions"" (he is promptly cut off by the station and replaced with a ""Technical Difficulties"" card depicting Brockman in a straitjacket). Revelation is in the New Testament, suggesting Brockman no longer observes Judaism.
 Kent Brockman embraces the ""Do what you feel"" craze. Brockman has been shown to have no problem with using bad or otherwise offensive language on air, and he has been fired for doing so on more than one occasion, though he has always been rehired. Brockman was fired for muttering, ""That oughta hold those SOBs,"" after reporting on Gabbo's identical gaffe in a My Two Cents segment. After Brad Goodman encouraged Springfield to ""do what they feel"", Kent Brockman reports that because of Brad Goodman exploiting Bart's irreverent personality, people in Springfield are becoming more open with themselves, then says, ""...and this reporter thinks it's about fucking time!"" (with ""fuck"" being bleeped out) and isn't fired for his remark (This is presumably because of the ""do what you feel"" craze making trouble-making rules lenient by a significant degree, as he was also seen spraying whipped cream into his mouth shortly thereafter). During the boxing match between Homer and Drederick Tatum, when introduced and pelted with junk by an irate audience, he also yelled ""Go to hell!"" in response, though it was implied that he was present in a non-official capacity beyond celebrity status.
 When Kent Brockman, after chastising democracy when a last-minute rider in the senate ruined the evacuation of Springfield due to an incoming comet, he decided to announce which people are gay (He based these theories on hearsay, conjecture, assumption and good old fashioned small town gossip) on the grounds that it didn't matter, as he was going to lose the job anyway. He also managed to yell ""Penis"" on the air once without either being reprimanded for it or it even being bleeped out (although in that particular case, he was doing it to prove that the special live report for the Democratic candidate for the United States House of Representatives, John Armstrong, was an actual live report).
 
In addition, in A Tale of Two Springfields, he also mentioned Golden Showers (i.e., slang for peeing on someone) on the air when ""thanking"" Homer Simpson for ensuring Olde Springfield had a Gold Rush (although given his confused reaction to people off screen laughing hysterically at the statement after saying it, as well as the context, he was probably meaning literal golden showers as in golden shower heads, and he was trying to be sincere). On a similar note, he also once said ""I pee freely"" on the air without being reprimanded or even bleeped out (although in that case, it was implied that he had been tricked into saying it on the air by drunken fraternity boys regarding a giant lizard doing a destructive fight in Springfield, and more specifically as ""I.P. Freely"", and he proceeded to groan in irritation upon realizing what he had actually said.). Brockman's penchant for using offensive language worked against him, when, after Homer accidentally spills coffee on Brockman's crotch, he shouts what Ned Flanders calls a ""super swear"" that shocked everyone who watched it (""That hurt like a motherfucker!"", with ""motherfucker"" being muffled). Brockman was demoted to weather man due to the station paying a fine to the FCC, but was then fired when the network executives mistook a ring of Splenda in Brockman's coffee for cocaine (although it was hinted that they also may have been looking for an excuse to fire him). Brockman was later given his job back to silence him (after doing an expose that was seen on YouTube uncovering the real reason the FCC is cracking down on obscenity in the media), with a 50% raise, making his new salary $750,000 per year.  Smartline In ""Bartman Begins"", Brockman saw Kearney and said that he was the man who was dating his daughter, Brittany. Janice told Kent that Kearney was in a band called ""Maggot Barf"", but Kearney corrected that as ""Barf Maggot"" and said that he wouldn't get it. Later, a tip comes in about a robbery at the museum, but Kent is only focused on what Pres Hilton is up to. Eventually, he says that the Museum is at least temporarily safe from bullies.
 In ""Around the World in 80 Bites"", Kent tells Homer that he is gonna enter the Duff Eating Contest, but he never did. Later, he tells Homer that eating 500 pounds of Low Great Meat is quite the legacy.
 In ""Mob Rules"", Brockman is one of the people to join Marge's mob to ban Grand Theft Scratchy: Blood Island. He later talks to Sherri (or Terri) about how her mom has a crush on him, which made her husband mad and divorced her, so she says that he ruined her family.
 In ""Shadow of the Colossal Donut"", Brockman says to Homer that if he'd be willing to fight Lard Lad, he could report on his struggle and demise. Kent reports on Homer and Bart fighting Lard Lad, which was a success.
 After the game, Kent says that they gonna run the Lard Lad Segment over the end credits. He tells Homer that he only wished the aliens invaded the Mall during Sweeps.
 Kent Brockman makes an appearance in this game. He appears in the Level 1 cutscene, heard in house gags in levels 1, 4 and 7, and heard in the first mission of level 7 where his brain is eaten by zombies.
 Brockman's most famous phrase, repeated in various guises on internet message boards and within popular culture, is ""And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords"". Another notable quote: ""I've said it before and I'll say it again: Democracy simply doesn't work.""
 There are a few people who could be the inspiration and/or model for Brockman, including the late Los Angeles news anchors Jerry Dunphy and Hal Fishman; the late San Luis Obispo news anchor Rick Martel; Canada's Lloyd Robertson; and Ted Baxter, the airhead news anchor from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, played by Ted Knight. He has also been seen to emulate Ted Koppel, Walter Cronkite or Max Keeping.

Scott Christian,True,False,False,False,False,1,Castellaneta,51,"Scott Christian is the far less famous co-anchor for Channel 6 News. Christian is most likely overshadowed by Kent Brockman because of his slow boring tone of voice and facial expression. He is also known to go out in the field as well and report on stories interviewing Springfieldians. Although his outward appearance makes him seem boring he indeed does enjoy partying with Springfield's other celebrities. In later episodes he is also occasionally seen reporting as anchor, often when Kent Brockman is freelance reporting.
 Christian has been seen on several different occasions to have drastically different hair colors. In most cases he is seen to have black hair, but several other times he has been seen with bright orange hair.

Judge Roy Snyder,True,False,False,False,False,1,Castellaneta,52,"Judge Roy Snyder is one of the main judges in Springfield, or perhaps more specifically, Springfield County.
 He was once known as a no-nonsense judge but over the years he has loosened up and become more lenient. His temperament seems to be milder than that of the Judge Constance Harm, who is more strict.
 Snyder has somewhat of a grudge against Lionel Hutz for repeatedly running over his son with his car. It is unknown how old Snyder's son is or if he survived. Judge Snyder also admitted in court that his wife had left him, since then he has been seen with Lindsey Naegle.
 When it comes to Bart, he normally lets him off the hook using the reasoning: ""Boys will be boys"". He was the judge who banned sugar in Springfield, though later cancelled the law, and also ordered the ruling of never mentioning anything about the ""real Seymour Skinner"" under penalty of torture. At one point, when decreeing that Mr. Burns has to pay a fine of three million dollars after being caught by the EPA for illegally dumping nuclear waste in a park, he allowed for Mr. Burns to, in exchange, have the Justice statue.
 He was later shown to be a member of Big is Beautiful and attended several of their protests and Albert's funeral.

Bumblebee Man,True,False,False,False,True,4,Azaria,53,"Pedro Chespirito, or Bumblebee Man, is the star of a Spanish-language television sitcom on Channel 8, in which he dresses in a bumblebee costume and performs slapstick comedy.
 The Bumblebee Man is the star of a Mexican Spanish-language television sitcom on Channel Ocho, in which he dresses in a bumblebee costume and performs Slapstick comedy.
 Bumblebee Man never takes off his costume in public, and almost never in private. The sole exception is a short segment showing his private life in ""22 Short Films About Springfield"". In addition to being seen costume-less, Bumblebee Man is shown as being genuinely clumsy rather than simply acting as such. In the end, his house is destroyed and his wife leaves him .
 His bowling shirt has the name Pedro on it , which is his first name.
 Bumblebee Man speaks Spanish primarily, but is once shown speaking in articulate English when he replaced Kent Brockman for a brief moment and when talking to his producer .
 Generally, Bumblebee Man speaks in simple, over-enunciated (and often inaccurate) Spanish sentences. His catchphrases of choice are typically ""¡Ay, ay, ay, no me gusta!"" (""I don't like it!""), ""¡Ay, ay, ay, no es bueno!"" (""That's not good!"") and ""¡Ay, Dios no me ama!"" (""God doesn't love me!""). Quite commonly, his phrases will be intentionally sloppy Spanish: For example, saying ""wudpequero"" for ""woodpecker,"" when it's actually ""pájaro carpintero"" . This can be explained by influences from the English-speaking community which he lives in.
 In The Simpsons: Tapped Out, he confesses to Lisa that he is actually Norwegian (even though the whole game is non-canon).
 In the few instances that he speaks English, he uses a southeastern British Accent.
 Bumblebee Man as chihuahua. In ""Flaming Moe"", Bumblebee Man is indicated to be a member of the Furry fandom (a fanbase for anthropomorphic animals), and is shown holding a sign saying ""Furries Fur Moe"".
 He got kissed by a donkey in The Simpsons Movie.
 Bumblebee Man appears as one of the contestants in the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge.
 Bumblebee Man comments that he is originally from Norway and he takes Spanish lessons.
 At the end of the special Troy McClure explains that Selma will marry him.
 In the final segment of ""Treehouse of Horror X"", he shown boarding the rocket ship to Mars.
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XX"", he is seen as zombie.
 He is shown sitting next to Consuela.
 Bumblebee Man is a caricature of El Chapulín Colorado (""The Red Grasshopper""), a character created and portrayed by Mexican television comedian Roberto Gómez Bolaños (best known by his pseudonym ""Chespirito""), and his show consists of simple skits, often involving heavy slapstick. Channel 8 is a reference to El Chavo del Ocho, by the same creators. In several DVD commentaries, the show's producers say that whenever they watched Telemundo, this character was always ""on,"" and then they created Bumblebee Man, who is also always ""on"". Roberto Gómez Bolaños passed away on November 28th, 2014.
 In the Spanish-language version of the show, the humor of Bumblebee Man (known in this version as Hombre Abejorro in the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America, or El Hombre Abeja in Spain) relies on the fact that he wears a gigantic bee costume and frequently engages in physical comedy; there has been no effort made to translate his speech to another language. However, in the Latin American version, he speaks with an over-the-top Mexican accent and in the version that airs in Spain, he does so with a Mexican accent. The Japanese version leaves Hank Azaria's performance untouched.

Capital City Goofball,True,False,False,False,False,2,stars,54,"The Capital City Goofball is the mascot of Capital City.
 His appearance seems to have been inspired by the mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, the Philly Phanatic.
 The costume is a creature with a baseball body, with a blue Capital City T-Shirt, yellow arms and legs, a long flat-ended nose, tufts of fur at the side, a red hat with two springs, two costume eyes that look in either direction, and two more eyes that peek out from the mouth (the eyes of the person wearing the costume).
 Capital City Goofball first appeared in ""Do the Bartman"". In ""Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade"", The Capital City Goofball represents Capital City in the state Legislature; he spent 80 million dollars out of his own pocket to win the seat. During a Legislative meeting, he brings that the state should change their flag, saying the Confederate Symbol on it was an embarrassment, especially because they were a Northern state. ""Homer to the Max"" implies that the Capital City Goofball was originally conceived as a major recurring character, but has only appeared in occasional background scenes since his debut, and has never had any further speaking lines. He appeared briefly in ""Homerazzi"". A statue of him (as a parody of the Christ the Redeemer statue) can be seen in ""Whiskey Business"".
 He was also released in The Simpsons: Tapped Out.

 Carlton Carlisle ""Carl"" Carlson, Jr. (born April 20, 1955) is a recurring character in The Simpsons and a supporting character in The Simpsons Movie. He is a safety operations supervisor from Sector 7G of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, where he works alongside his childhood friends Lenny Leonard and Homer Simpson.
 Carl is a self-restrained organized (although not maniac about it, like Frank Grimes) employee and likes to call himself ""an urban Lenny"". It is hinted in the series that he and Lenny may be more than just friends.
 Carl also attended Springfield A&amp;M University and possesses a master's degree in nuclear physics. He also possesses an IQ of 214, making him the smartest adult in the series, second only to Martin Prince. Mr. Burns once implied that he was a war hero.
 Carl is an African American Buddhist who apparently grew up in Iceland (he once nostalgically referred to his ""Icelandic boyhood""). He holds a master's degree in nuclear physics and is fond of bowling and drinking at Moe's Tavern.
 Lenny, Carl and Homer have apparently been friends for most of their lives. Flashbacks show them as friends during childhood and high school, and they all began working at the nuclear power plant around the same time.
 Carl often serves as a taciturn, straightforward man to Homer and company, probably because of his harsh but true opinions of others. On one occasion, he makes everyone in Moe's Tavern cry and then turns to the camera, explaining: ""See, this is why I don't talk much.""
 He is Lenny's best friend, often being seen with him. He is also Homer's friend, and it was shown that Carl's willing to help Homer in several different jobs, such as when he and lenny helped Homer run the private security company SprinShield, a company created due to the police forces incompetence. 
 However, Carl is also a person with a coward streak. When Fat Tony and several others criminal chiefs started to aim towards SpringShield due to making a far better job than the actual police, Carl and Lenny, fearing for their lives, literally locked themselves up in one of the station's cells, leaving Homer on his own. Aside, due to Wiggum becoming Police Chief again, this may be one of the reasons SpringShield was shut down.
 There is a constant allusion to homo-eroticism in Lenny's and Carl's relationship, although no one seems to care much about it, particularly Carl. Lenny seems to deeply idolize Carl, yet Carl is usually indifferent or oblivious to the attention.
 Lenny once dreamily recalled carving ""Mount Carlmore"", a huge bust of Carl in the side of a sandstone cliff, during ""one wonderful summer"". When Homer asks Lenny what Carl thought of it, Lenny replies ""You know, we've never discussed it.""
 When various characters looked at the stars to ""see into their souls"" during a blackout in Springfield, Lenny sees an image of Carl, and Carl sees an image of himself. On another occasion, Lenny and Carl are at the Springfield Baseball Stadium, watching the Kiss Cam, and Lenny says: ""Remember when we used to kiss like that, Carl? With our respective girlfriends?"" Lenny once said he can't tell apart the remains of his sculpture with Carl's remarking ""I don't know where Carl ends and I begin!"", An irritated Carl interjects ""it's stuff like this that makes everyone think we're gay.""
 At the same time, there have been many scenes that counter the homoerotic narrative. Carl and Lenny drunkenly suggest to a sober Barney that he will take them to the Playboy Mansion and the Girls College, respectively. Although not seen by the audience, Carl claims to have a girlfriend who is having an affair with one of the VP's at the power plant to feed Carl inside information. While at a football game, he mentioned planning to give his wife a ring for their anniversary. Carl has been seen with a woman when he attends Homer's marriage class and Homer has mentioned that Carl and Lenny have mistresses they spend time with. In addition, he and Lenny were clearly aroused by the female stars of Lemony Lick-It's A Series of Horny Events when they accidentally stumbled upon the filming of the film, and were also shown to be extremely willing to take up Homer's bribe of giving them roles to buy their silence to Marge, their opting to do the sex scenes with the girls and be the foul-mouth boy, respectively. In addition, when Homer was describing a movie he saw that weekend regarding a buxom blonde (implied to be the same movie Mr. Burns held disgust over due to her being ""naked as a jaybird"" for half the film), Carl, alongside Lenny, acknowledged that it was ""their kind of film"" in bemusement, while also proceeding to oink (alluding to Mr. Burns' earlier claim of how the unwashed masses will ""oink for more"" regarding oversize breasts and a happy end.).
 At times, Carl gets annoyed at Lenny. When Carl learns that he is paired with Lenny in a team-building exercise on a power plant retreat, his irritated response is, ""Aw, nuts.  I mean...aw, nuts."" It should also be noted that earlier in that event, Carl and Lenny, shortly after a fire drill at the plant that went south and thus necessitated the team-building exercise in the first place, got into a huge fight.
 At one point, when a fire was about to hit the flammable district during Springfield's massive fire, Lenny mentioned that their mother was working there, suggesting they were maternal half-siblings.
 Carl and Lenny both have the long-form of their first name as their surnames: Carlson and Leonard.
 Carl works in sector 7G along with Homer and Lenny. Carl's job position over the course of the series has generally been that of a supervisor, as mentioned in ""Blood Feud"" and implied by Mr. Burns' high regard for him in comparison to Homer and Lenny. Carl's position may have changed throughout the course of the show however, as he was again promoted to supervisor after Ted, a previous supervisor, left.
 Carl played bass in Homer's band Sadgasm, which later broke up.
 Number 14 Carl Tapped Out In The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run, Carl appears in Level one as the boss for the mission, The Fat and the Furious.
 In The Simpsons Game, Carl and Lenny are shown arguing while bird-watching, and having forgotten Lisa and Bart's names when they save Lenny and Carl from logging machinery, even though Lenny and Carl have known them in their whole lives. During a conversation in the Springfield Hub, Carl and Bernice Hibbert are hinted to have had a past relationship that Carl wants to rekindle. He also mentions in this game his support for Obama.
 In ""Future-Drama"", Milhouse asks him and Lenny to pull him out between two, but they claim to be ghosts and their spirits in the trees Milhouse or they are alive and jerking him around.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", he and Lenny switched brains because Lenny wanted to back together with his wife, who was sleeping with Carl at the time, but she switched with a monkey on a Japanese game show.
 In ""The Simpsons/Family Guy"" crossover he sits next Cleveland Brown, where they assume that they are the two funny guys in their towns.
 Carl is also part of ""The Guys"", a friend group which consists of him, Lenny, Homer and Moe.
 Carl is a Buddhist, although not a very dedicated one like Lisa (Richard Gere described Lenny and Carl's mediation practices as ""way off""). He is sometimes seen in the Christian First Church of Springfield.
 In the early seasons, Carl was rarely seen with Lenny and did not have a consistent voice, but on some occasions, he can be heard with Lenny's voice and vice versa. In ""Principal Charming"", Carl's name is spelled ""Karl""- like Karl from ""Simpson and Delilah"".

Princess Kashmir,False,False,False,False,False,1,Hayden,56,"Princess Kashmir (real name Shauna Tifton) is an exotic dancer.
 Princess Kashmir was first seen during Eugene Fisk's bachelor party for someone who happens a co-worker of Homer. It is here that Homer danced alongside her and got his picture taken by Bart with his spy camera which eventually got him into trouble from Marge. The photo had far more effect on Homer than it did on Tifton.
 She was moved by Homer's speech to all the men in the audience about not treating women as objects, but she remains an exotic dancer to this day.
 She has been known to work at ""Florence of Arabia"", ""Girlesque"", ""Foxy Boxing"", ""Mud City"", ""Sapphire Lounge"" and as a fan dancer at ""La Maison Derrière"", where Homer payed more attention to her rather than to a conversation between him and Belle.
 She is seen with many men throughout the series, including Apu before his marriage to Manjula. However, Apu was not much of a sexual performer due to him being preoccupied with his business. When Apu went to work and saw Homer loafing, he angrily demanded Homer get to work, but Tifton looked with shock as Homer collapsed from exhaustion and got his head stuck in the automatic door. Tifton is also a member of the Home Wreckers bowling team along with Mindy Simmons, Lurleen Lumpkin and Jacques.
 She is also somewhat of a celebrity in Springfield, appearing regularly on Springfield Squares and played Eleanor Roosevelt in a play with Krusty the Clown as FDR (who broke character when he got out of the wheelchair) as seen on ""A Star is Burns"". She also was one of the celebrities who sang with Sting, the song ""We're Sending Our Love Down the Well"".

Crazy Cat Lady,False,False,False,False,False,9,MacNeille,57,"Catamaran Lady Eleanor Abernathy, better known as the Crazy Cat Lady, is a mentally ill hoarder woman who always surrounds herself with a large number of cats. She usually screams gibberish and/or throws her cats at passersby. She gives Lisa one of her cats, Snowball V, who looks exactly like her original Snowball II. She is 40 years old, although she appears elderly.
 Eleanor at age 24 When she was eight, Eleanor Abernathy was a smart and ambitious young girl who wanted to be both a lawyer and a doctor ""because a woman can do anything"". She was studying for law school at 16, and by 24, she had earned an MD from Harvard Medical School and a JD from Yale Law School. However, by 32, suffering from burnout, she had turned to alcohol, became obsessed with her pet cat, and would randomly take to cutting pieces of her own hair. By the time she was 40, she had assumed her present state as a drunken, raving lunatic. She once shared a cat with Moe.
 In Abernathy's first appearance, Lisa stands in front of Abernathy's house and attempts to cast her in a positive light, asking, ""Can anyone who loves animals so much, really be crazy?"" At this point, Abernathy emerges from her house throwing cats and pursues Lisa throughout town.
 Even without medication, she appears to be very intelligent. When Mayor Quimby is recalled, she runs for the mayor's office. During a candidate debate, she is asked what public policy issues are important to her. Unlike the other candidates (who act as stereotypical dishonest politicians), Abernathy discusses issues such as health care, economy, and public education in between her screams and gibberish (and a call for cats ""in everyone's pants"").
 The Cat Lady enjoys ""brief moments of lucidity"" after taking psychoactive medication. She abruptly resumes her usual bizarre behavior when Marge mentions that the ""pills"" are actually Reese's Pieces. Her medication helps her speak intelligibly rather than her usual gibberish. She has a hoarding disorder, which it is later revealed in the episode ""A Midsummer's Nice Dream"" is the current cause of her mental illness. However, in her first appearance, while Lisa is doing a news report, she asks ""Can anyone who loves animals this much really be crazy?"". However, Lisa likely wasn’t aware of the cats’s distress.
 In the final segment In the Belly of the Boss,  at the Invention Expo she is seen mutter gibberish which translates into ""I have a serious brain disease. Please give me a cat.""

Gary Chalmers,True,False,False,True,True,4,Azaria,58,"Garibaldi ""Gary"" Chalmers III, better known as Superintendent Chalmers, is the superintendent of the Springfield Unified School District, which includes Springfield Elementary alongside either seven or 13 other schools.
 A quick-tempered school administrator, he is also a survivalist, fisherman, widower, and the father of Shauna Chalmers. 
 Garibaldi Chalmers III was born around November 22 - December 21 (as he mentions to Skinner that he is a Sagittarius). In Season 16's ""Pranksta Rap,"" his age is specified to be ""40-something"", likely in his late 40s, meaning he was born around March 18th 1940-1945.
 Chalmers originally hails from Utica, New York. He has also mentioned that he comes from Queens, New York; and then moved to Intercourse, Pennsylvania.
 In a deleted scene of Wild Barts Can't Be Broken, the kids insinuate that Superintendent Chalmers was born in a Spanish-speaking country and immigrated illegally to the US.
 He attended Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, although an unidentified Simpsons comic states that he went to Louisiana State University.
 Chalmers sobbing on Dr. Raufbold during group therapy, while describing his traumatic relationship with his father. Chalmers's father was a psychologist, who was admirer of real-life behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner. In his childhood, Chalmers's father put Gary through cruel and unusual psychological experiments, such as forcing him to go through mazes in order to eat breakfast.
 These ""mazes"" were likely operant conditioning chambers (a.k.a. Skinner boxes), invented in the 1930s and typically used to experiment on animals such as birds and lab rats. In ""Bull-E"", Chalmers recounts these circumstances during group therapy, after being asked by Dr. Raufbold whether he had even been humiliated. Although Gary begins his explanation seriously and uses the word ""father"", he soon becomes overcome with emotion, regressing and sobbing about his lack of fatherly love before crawling up to embrace Dr. Raufbold with barely intelligible sobs.
 Chalmers is a temperamental and whimsical man unfortunately vested with authority. His mood abruptly swings, and he seemingly arbitrarily plays favorites. Bill Oakley expressed fondness for Chalmers's personality, comparing him to Frank Grimes in that both characters seem to ""operate in the normal human universe"" as opposed to the cartoonish world of Springfield.
 Chalmers tutoring Bart Simpson. In his youth, Chalmers was a high school teacher, but was put off the profession after he was beaten up by the fight club thinking it was the ""breakfast club."" He was coerced back into teaching for a short while decades later, taking Bart Simpson under his wing and managing to get through to the boy where others had failed.
 He manages multiple principals within the Springfield district, including principals Skinner, Duggins, Finch (later fired), Principals Weinberg, Sackett, and Hertzfeld-Mastroantonio. The exact number of schools under Chalmers's jurisdiction varies; he once mentions managing a total of eight principals, and in another, Chalmers states he oversees 14 schools. Other supervised schools besides Springfield Elementary include the Springfield Creative Arts Academy and Waverly Hills Elementary School.
 Chalmers highly unamused during ""Whacking Day."" While constantly having little to no tolerance for Principal Skinner's well-intentioned mistakes, he shows apathy and dismissiveness of Ned Flanders' absolute lack of discipline during his brief tenure as principal of Springfield Elementary. He has claimed his only reason for constant hostility towards Principal Skinner is that Skinner ""really bugs him"".
 Most times he visits Springfield Elementary, especially in inspections during earlier seasons, some sort of disaster strikes. He produces extreme anxiety in Principal Skinner, who offers increasingly improbable stories to explain what is happening. 
 Chalmers is known for throwing open doors to rooms and bellowing ""SKINNERRRRR!!!"" or ""SEYMOUR!!!"", to which Seymour stammers, ""S-Superintendent Chalmers!"" His catchphrase has caused some paranoia in Skinner. He claimed to never raise his voice at the other principals he oversees, although he did so to Principals Weinberg, Sackett, and Gwendolyn Hertzfeld-Mastroantonio. On a few occasions, he says Skinner's name (or in some case, words pronounced similarly to ""Skinner"" such as ""Skimmers"" or ""Dinner"") this way when absolutely nothing has gone wrong, implying that he either pronounces Skinner's name this way by habit; does it on purpose to scare him; or is triggered by his childhood trauma regarding psychologist B. F. Skinner - or a combination of all of these. 
 Chalmers has also, on rare occasions, shown a caring side towards Skinner, when he called out for Skinner and when he had a reply that Skinner was okay, he told Skinner to ""Never do that again"" (scare him). In ""24 Minutes"", he is also upset at Skinner misinterpreting his reaction to a bake sale, angrily huffing, ""You don't know me at all."" Similarly, he had at least some grudging respect for Skinner, as he personally organized the surprise 20th-anniversary celebration of Skinner's time as principal of Springfield Elementary and even made an unscheduled and secret visit to the school specifically to make the announcement before Skinner arrived at the Teacher's Lounge (although he did express annoyance at Skinner's meticulous inspections throughout the school, exclaiming, ""Good lord! The rod up that man's butt must have a rod up its butt."" after barely arriving at the Teacher's Lounge undetected by Skinner). He also worked with Skinner during the disastrous Edutainment event at Springfield Elementary School, where he and Skinner portrayed Bud Abbot and Lou Costello's respective roles in their famous ""Who's on First"" comedy routine (although Chalmers eventually snapped at Skinner, walked offstage, and bitterly referred to him as a ""sexless freak"" after Skinner messed up the routine).
 Chalmers' own competence and dedication to his job are questionable. He was once heard complaining about Springfield Elementary and its classrooms full of ""ugly, ugly children"". He let Ned Flanders allow the school to descend into anarchy when he was principal, freely admitting that he had fired Skinner for far less, explaining simply that ""Skinner really bugged me."" In fact, the only reason Chalmers even allowed Skinner to be reinstated as Principal at that time was that Ned Flanders introduced prayer into the school (because Chalmers feels that religion should never be placed within school walls, just as facts don't have a place within an organized religion). When asked about Skinner's reinstatement, he said simply, ""Ehh, he seems to know the students' names."" Another time, in order to placate an angry mob of women after Skinner made a statement that sounded very sexist, Chalmers replaced Skinner with a female principal, Melanie Upfoot, who was undeniably even more gender-biased -- Melanie's first order of business was the segregation of male and female students. Chalmers seems disturbingly unconcerned with the school's decline, saying that ""the way America's public schools are sliding, they'll all be like this in a matter of months. I say enjoy it — it's a hell of a toboggan ride!"" On another occasion, however, Skinner once told Chalmers that ""a caring superintendent"" was something the kids of Springfield Elementary certainly did not lack.
 On a related note, he was also in on Skinner's attempt at cheating out grant money after it became apparent Lisa had cheated on an important standardized test; Chalmers was completely unconcerned about using unearned grants when Lisa reported Skinner to him. He also promotes people based on personal bias as opposed to actual competence, promoting Principal Holloway (described by Skinner as a ""drunk"" and Chalmers as a ""pill-popper"") to assistant superintendent, overlooking the efforts made by Skinner to improve his school's standing.
 Chalmers is a proud owner of a 1979 Honda Accord (and later, a Camry, which Otto Mann promptly wrecks).
 As of Season 32's ""Diary Queen"", he drives a red sedan with a license plate reading ""SKIN-NER."" He keeps the keys in his sun visor (allowing Bart to steal his car), information Bart learned via reading the late Edna Krabappel's diary.
 Chalmers shouting at fish after being terminated. ""Livin' La Pura Vida"" reveals that Chalmers has befriended the Van Houtens, as he and his daughter are among the few families the Van Houtens invite on their annual Costa Rica trip. Other families include the Hibberts and, for the first time, the Simpsons. 
 In Season 33's ""Habeas Tortoise,"" Homer knocks on the Chalmers' door due to their house's proximity to the zoo, to gain security-cam footage for his Facebook conspiracy group, ""Lost Leonard."" After agreeing to share the footage, Chalmers expresses a modest desire to join, and Homer happily welcomes him. He seems to closely befriend the other members of the group: Sideshow Mel, Drederick Tatum, Comic Book Guy, Gil, and Miss Hoover (Homer states that ""Those friendless weirdos have become my best weird friends."")
 Later that season, in ""Girls Just Shauna Have Fun"", Chalmers warmly greets Homer as ""Simpson!"" and invites him to try his home-brewed Trappist beer. This leads to Chalmers training Homer on the history and methods of Belgian Trappist brewing, complete with matching monk costumes. After they collaborate to create their own brew titled ""Thirst Trappist Hunky Monks Ale"", complete with a logo of the two of them. After nearly facing arrest, Chalmers panics that his superintendent career is over, but a mistake made by Homer leads to their release from arrest. In his relief, Chalmers kisses Homer on the mouth and proclaims him a ""glorious idiot.""
 Chalmers has dated Agnes Skinner, much to Seymour's dismay.
 Edna Krabappel sent a carrier pigeon message to her ex-fiancé Seymour that said she and Chalmers were ""doing it"".
 Chalmers told a second-grade class he was dating ""one of your mothers. I forget whose.""
 During ""Ae Bonny Romance"", while in Scotland for the wedding of Groundskeeper Willie, he is shown romantically holding hands and smiling with lunch lady Doris Freedman. Upon seeing this, Homer Simpson implies that the romance will only last for the duration of the trip.
 Chalmers enthusing Bart, Milhouse, Nelson, Jimbo, and Dolph about an outdoor education. The urn for Rosemary Chalmers is visible. Chalmers is a widower, having lost his wife Rosemary Chalmers to an unidentified illness. 
 In ""Pranksta Rap"", he worked as a bodyguard for Alcatraaz, dressing in white gangster clothing and telling Skinner to ""step off, dog"" for the entertainment of the rappers. He then quietly tells Skinner he is aware they are making fun of him, but his wife is ""very, very sick."" Thereby it can be supposed that he was knowingly embarrassing himself to raise money in an attempt to curse his wife's illness. 
 By Season 23's ""Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts"", he has built an urn for Rosemary Chalmers, which is displayed on the mantle of his fireplace.
 Chalmers confirms his wife's death in ""Bart's Not Dead""; the bullies tease Principal Skinner, asking why he doesn't marry Chalmers if he likes him so much. Skinner responds that, as superintendent, Chalmers is married to all the principals. Chalmers bitterly responds, ""Thank you. You've made the anniversary of my wife's death even more depressing.""
 Chalmers home-brewing beer in his garage, from ""Girls Just Shauna Have Fun"" Chalmers sharpening a knife among the doomsday preppers. Chalmers's doomsday-prepped basement. Not visible are 4 automatic rifles. Chalmers is a survivalist, doomsday prepper, conspiracy theorist, Republican party member, and Presbylutheran. 
 He enjoys fishing and has competed in at least one fishing competition. Chalmers is also a hobbyist beer brewer; Chalmers has set up an elaborate brewery in his garage in order to home-brew his own Trappist-style beer, drawing inspiration from Belgian Trappist monks. He collaborates with Homer on this venture during ""Girls Just Shauna Have Fun"". 
 In ""Homer Goes to Prep School"" he is a member of the Doomsday Preppers (people who prepare for anarchy, believing the society will collapse at any moment due to an electromagnetic pulse). His basement is stocked with food and other supplies needed to survive the end of society. When Lloyd said that they shouldn't look at the faces of people who didn't prepare, Chalmers shows them a solution to the problem: a rifle scope that makes any human face look dangerous and threatening (by placing angry eyebrows on their faces). In an uncharacteristically low voice, he insinuates that he would feel no remorse shooting anyone, including Maggie. When Lindsay Nagle seems concerned, he blurts out that she probably think he's going mad with power. Near the end of the episode when Lloyd mentions that in the new world he would be a big-shot, Chalmers admits that he and the others were planning to seal Lloyd in a cave. When Lloyd mentions he was going to poison their drinking water, Chalmers proclaims that he will drink his own urine.
 Chalmers is also a conspiracy theorist. In ""Habeas Tortoise"", Homer invites him to join a Facebook group of skeptics desiring to discover the truth behind the zoo's missing tortoise. After joining the group, he feels more and more comfortable to befriend them all and express a variety of conspiratorial beliefs. During the episode's wedding of Gil Gunderson and Elizabeth Hoover, he sings a romantic cover version of Sam Cooke's ""Wonderful World,"" wherein he condemns science textbooks and claims ""the virus was caused by 5G"". 
 Chalmers at a meeting of the Springfield Republican Party alongside Krusty, the Rich Texan, a vampire, Wolfcastle, Burns, and an unidentified character. In ""The Kid is All Right"", he is shown to be a member of the Springfield Republican Party, who meet in an ominous tower usually accompanied by a lightning strike. Since he fired Ned for introducing prayer to school in ""Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"" and advocated for a government grant to Springfield Elementary School in ""Lisa Gets an ""A"""", he is likely a moderate Republican, in contrast to social conservatives like Ned or economic extremists like Mr. Burns. 
 In ""Daddicus Finch"", Chalmers hosts Shauna's Bat Mitzvah at a synagogue; she recites the Scriptures in Hebrew, albeit unenthusiastically, indicating that his daughter is of Jewish heritage. However, Chalmers himself is frequently seen at the First Church of Springfield (including in the Springfield movie), mispronounces meshuggeneh in the same episode, looks unenthusiastic during the Hora, rushes the Rabbi's anecdotes, and has a non-Jewish first and last name. Therefore, he is most likely Presbylutheran like most of Springfield, while Shauna's late mother Rosemary Chalmers was Jewish.
 When Springfield began installing surveillance cameras around Springfield and 742 Evergreen Terrace is discovered to be a blind spot, the Simpsons' backyard is transformed into a gathering place for rebellious activity. During the daytime chaos, Superintendent Chalmers swings a pair of nun-chucks while prancing in a frilly dress. Upon being spotted by Ned and Homer, he stops and reacts with shame, explaining, ""This used to be just a little part of me.""
 Gary suggesting that Shauna conserve her phone battery before their trip to Costa Rica. In the episode ""How The Test Was Won"", Seymour Skinner mentions that Chalmers has a daughter from whom Skinner buys wrapping paper. The next episode ""What to Expect When Bart's Expecting"" revealed that Shauna is his daughter. He may be considered a caring and empathetic father, showing unconditional emotional support for Shauna during their trip to Costa Rica in ""Livin' La Pura Vida"".
 Shauna blocks him on all social media, but to keep her safe, Chalmers follows her under the alias ""Rodrigo,"" a goth teen from Argentina.
 Chalmers has grey hair; he stipulates that he is bald-ing, not bald. He wears a dark blue suit, a white dress shirt, a red tie, and black shoes. 
 According to a deleted scene, his blue suit is Armani (he wags a fist and screams, ""Damn you, Armani!"" when his suit shrinks).
 In his youth, he had brown hair with a combover.
 In the episode ""Future-Drama"", which takes place in the future, the elderly Superintendent Chalmers has undergone significant dementia (because of a stim attack, which was revealed by Skinner). He rides a moped and has severe aphasia to the point of repeating his trademark line constantly while spinning around in a continuously 360-degree circle.
 In the episode ""Holidays of Future Passed"", Superintendent Chalmers is shown to be frozen in the Springfield Cryogenic Facility, along with other elderly characters.
 In the episode ""Mother and Child Reunion"", Chalmers (as Elder Chalmers) makes sexist comments about President Lisa running for state school superintendent, but concedes.
 Chalmers appears in The Simpsons Game walking around the Towns Square with Lenny Leonard, Krusty the Clown, Charlie (SNPP) Julius Hibbert and Kent Brockman. Later when the Aliens arrive in Springfield, Chalmers tells Edna Krabappel the end may be upon them. Edna agrees and says they should roll around in the hay before they pass on. Chalmers refuses Edna then says ""If Seymour ever found out he would be devastated."" Chalmers then agreed to roll around in the hay with Edna.
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XVII"", Chalmers asks Skinner to just let the Golem kill him.
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XX"", Chalmers is one of the many residents who were turned into zombies.
 In the third segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XXII"", Chalmers (as Mecha-Chalmers) is the main antagonist, playing a character similar to Colonel Miles Quaritch from Avatar. He is a colonel of an army that he leads on the planet Rigel 7 to fight the Rigellians, to get Hillarium, a liquid that makes everything funny. He is defeated after Bart makes Mecha-Chalmers slap himself in a large robot suit that he controls by movement, telling him he had something on his face, thus making Mecha-Chalmers fall off a cliff.
 In the opening of ""Treehouse of Horror XXVIII"", Chalmers is a candy bar called Chalmond Joy.
 In Not It, Chalmers is named ""Super-Intense Kid Chalmers"".
 In ""Shanksgiving"", it is revealed he has a long lost twin brother named Police Superintendent Chalmers.
 In the DVD commentary to ""22 Short Films About Springfield"", Simpsons creators noted that Superintendent Chalmers seems to be one of the few ""normal"" characters on the show, and Chalmers is frequently alone in his awareness of the show's zaniness.

Comic Book Guy,True,True,False,True,False,2,Azaria,59,"Vomit Book Guy (by Bart) 
Jeffrey ""Jeff"" Albertson, better known as Comic Book Guy, is the morbidly obese, surly, sarcastic, and geeky proprietor of Springfield's local comic bookstore, The Android's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop.
 Comic Book Guy smiling Comic Book Guy is an obese and socially incompetent man who is perhaps best known for his sarcastic quips. He holds a master's degree in folklore and mythology (he translated The Lord of the Rings into Klingon as part of his thesis). He exhibits geeky behavior to an extraordinary and deliberately unrealistic degree, and often also makes references to obscure subjects or internet culture. His catchphrase is the declaration, ""Worst... (episode)... ever"". He states that he is a 45 year-old virgin who lives with his parents. Comic Book Guy is extremely obese, to the point where his clothes barely fit over his huge stomach. He also at one point suffered from lumbago.
 Appropriate to his nickname, Comic Book Guy is obsessed with comic books, pop culture, and science fiction. Comic Book Guy has a bumper sticker that reads ""My Other Car Is The Millennium Falcon,"" given to him by a Harrison Ford lookalike. The license plate on his AMC Gremlin is NCC-1701, the registry number of Star Trek's USS Enterprise. The contents of his display case include, among other oddities, a photo of Sean Connery signed by Roger Moore and a very rare Mary Worth in which she advised a friend to commit suicide. He also owns a T-shirt that says ""C:/DOS C:/DOS/RUN RUN/DOS/RUN"" (Notice the incorrect usage of the forward slash. DOS directories are listed with a backslash, so it would be ""C:\DOS C:\DOS\RUN RUN\DOS\RUN""). He is a member of the Springfield branch of Mensa, along with Principal Skinner, Dr. Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Professor Frink, and Lindsey Naegle. In the episode ""Beware My Cheating Bart"", he says he is a cyber bully.
 In the episode ""Large Marge"", Comic Book Guy had liposuction performed on him, so he would fit in a Superman costume. Likewise, he once applied several corsets onto himself so he'd look like Captain Kirk from Star Trek: The Original Series, although his girth was such that he ultimately couldn't contain his obesity anymore and ended up destroying his corsets in such a gradual manner that he ended up referencing the levels of weight gain by Kirk's actor William Shatner regarding various Star Trek roles he did, before grudgingly stating he was now at Boston Legal-levels. He also extensively modified what was originally Randall Curtis's outfit when about to see Cosmic Wars: The Gathering Shadow, including adding pregnancy pads in order to have it sufficiently adapt to his ""more unique body type.""
 Comic Book Guy Comic Book Guy is a middle-aged, obese, almost fanatical comic buff and displays deep passion regarding all fictional memorabilia in general, especially science fiction to the point of complete monomania. Sarcastic, irate and proudly geeky, Comic Book Guy does not treat anyone with kindness unless they are as passionate about comics as he is. Most of the character's infamy and trademarks are derived from his constant sarcastic observations, quips and distinct accent. Comic Book Guy's Obsessive-Compulsive fixation with comics is such that when somebody placed a Spider-Man comic inside The Spectacular Spider-Man slot, it was enough to make him angry. He is so stressed about people's comic book ignorance around him that it caused him to have a heart attack, while Dr. Hibbert later calls his profession as owner of a comic book store one of the most stressful jobs in the world, referring to it as the ""widow-maker"" (if any  had wives). 
 Aside from following Radioactive Man, the ongoing Hollywood movies and fast-paced internet nudity, Comic Book Guy is also a fan of Marvel and DC Comics such as Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, Fantastic Four, Hulk and many more. He also enjoys Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Game of Thrones, and Japanese anime. Comic Book Guy owns, amongst his vast collectibles, a Hulk melon baller (which he originally intended as a wedding gift to Skinner and Krabappel), costumes of Spider-Man, The Flash, Batman, Spock, and a Klingon Warrior, several life-sized cardboard cut-outs of various Star Wars characters, Star Wars sheets, and a Jar-Jar Binks figure which he sleeps with. Comic Book Guy speaks fluent Klingon, Mordor Black Speech, has set his life on routine of the Vulcan mating ritual Pon Farr, has a restraining order on Lynda Carter, and has a crush on Star Trek actress Nichelle Nichols, Batman's Catwoman, and Get Smart's Agent 99.
 Comic Book Guy's catchphrase Aside from his more onerous personality traits, Comic Book Guy is also prone to doing illegal behavior. Comic Book Guy has a massive collection of bootlegs of stolen movies, police interrogations and even ones regarding homeland security in his basement. This once got him arrested by the Springfield Police Department after his stash had somehow leaked to them. Likewise, he also attempted to illegally report on a test showing of the Mel Gibson remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington via a desktop computer, only for him to somehow get caught and thrown out of the Aztec Theater as well as having his computer junked by them (as well as expressing irritation at them neglecting to return the mouse to him until they promptly toss it back to them before politely thanking them).
 Comic Book Guy has a habit of stating his emotions and what is occurring or how he is feeling as it happens. When he was having a heart attack, he yelled out the symptoms; ""breath short, left arm numb"" before he collapsed and yelled ""can't go on describing symptoms any longer"". Comic Book Guy often states what he thinks in a matter-of-factual way, such as the method listing ""A, B"" and using words like ""correction"" or ""false"" whenever he corrects somebody. In addition, Comic Book Guy refers to comic books as if they were actuality, for example when Stan Lee entered the Android's Dungeon, he proclaims ""my heart is pounding like Thor's hammer against Doctor Doom's titanium breastplate"". He has shown to be one of the few characters who non-directly break the fourth wall in his canon appearances. For example, in season 11, when Marge asks if the Simpsons should get a horse when Bart wanted to adopt Duncan, Comic Book Guy noted that the Simpsons already had a horse in season 3 (even though he was not involved in that situation and didn't appear in that episode at all).
 Comic Book Guy treats most of his patrons cruelly and usually extorts his customers out of expensive collectibles or tricks them altogether into buying something. For example, claiming to Milhouse, who desperately needed it, that the bathroom was only for paying customers tricks him into buying a comic before allowing him to be taken away by his father, paying five dollars for priceless unseen Star Wars memorabilia and selling Fantastic Floors under Fantastic Four. Comic Book Guy is quite bitter, keeping a banned list of Milhouse, Bart (with those two being banned solely because they stopped Martha Price from unknowingly selling the aforementioned priceless unseen Star Wars memorabilia), Sideshow Bob, Nelson and Matt Groening in his store (although the first two he lifted the ban on after they saved his life upon having a heart attack), and after being made a fool of by Tom Savini during the latter's comic act, just prior to his heart attack, he angrily declared all the audience to be banned from his store for laughing at him. Once, he insulted Duff Beer in front of the patrons at Moe's Tavern while recovering from the aforementioned heart attack by calling it the ""nectar of the nitwit"", which resulted in him being thrown out of the bar (as well as Lenny attempting to partly break the Duff Beer bottle he had with the intention of stabbing Comic Book Guy with it as revenge, only to accidentally shatter the entire bottle). Although he lives a solitary lifestyle and his lack of social skills prevent him from ever making headway in a relationship with a woman until meeting his future wife Kumiko, Comic Book Guy proclaims before his near-certain death that a life of collecting comics and other fictions was a ""life well spent'.
 Although onerous, he has had some positive elements to him. For one thing, he willingly allowed Marge Simpson to access his recording of Abe's breakdown at church so she could transcribe what exactly Abe said, in exchange for Homer's long pajamas, and even attempted to aid Marge in figuring out what Grampa meant by ""Epa! Epa!"" to the best of his ability. He even assisted Homer and a group they both joined in finding the zoo’s missing tortoise, and in another instance, he attempted to give Ned Flanders a good luck prayer in Klingon before Ned went to confront Fit-Fat Tony.
 Comic Book Guy with Stan Lee. Comic Book Guy is the owner of The Android's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop, a local comic book store. Many of the comics and toys he sells are of very poor-quality, and often sell for very high prices. His store is his sanctuary, where he holds some level of self-esteem, imperiously lording over pre-teen kids, like Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, using a heavily sarcastic tone. When he was the target of mockery while trying to return the Ultimate Belt, he sighed, ""I must get back to my comic book store, where I dispense the insults rather than absorb them"". His store contains a section full of illegal videos, which include Mr. Rogers drunk, Alien Autopsy, Illegal Alien Autopsy, a top secret American nuclear war strategy session, a ""good version"" of The Godfather Part III, Kent Brockman picking his nose, and Ned Flanders in a police informant video, wherein he claims that Homer released a radioactive ape in his house (although, according to Bart, Homer only let the ape into the house because the ape tricked Homer, and not out of malicious intent). He later was arrested and had his store shut down temporarily because of this. He once had to give up the Ultimate Belt (which he won as a door prize at a Star Trek Convention) because, as he pointed out, ""the average Trekker has no use for a medium-sized belt"".
 Comic Book Guy's store At a small point in the episode ""Husbands and Knives"", due to a better comic book store opening across the street, it caused Comic Book Guy to go out of business, getting him to stoop to selling pretentious martial arts merchandise to children, but soon backfired after also having attempted to assassinate his competitor with his weapons. After that, Comic Book Guy was forced to close down his comic book store and became unemployed (which his place later turned into a females orientated gym). It's unclear how Comic Book Guy got his comic book store back as future episodes shows The Android's Dungeon again.
 In North Haverbrook, there is a comic book shop named ""Mylar Baggins"" and the proprietor bears a striking resemblance to Comic Book Guy with the exception that his skin and hair are slightly darker. He also has a deep-rooted rivalry with a store similar to his: ""Frodo's of Shelbyville"". However, in ""Homer the Whopper"", the owners of the various rival comic book stores (Mylar Baggins, Odin's of Shelbyville, and The Maltese Vulcan) all look different and Frodo's has apparently changed to ""Odin's of Shelbyville"". During the Trappuccino crisis, Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting is a ""life well spent"". In the episode ""Husband and Knives"" a bigger and better comic book store by the name of ""Coolsville Comics &amp; Toys"" is placed right across the street from The Androids Dungeon. The store is run by a man named Milo, who is the exact opposite of Comic Book Guy.
 In ""Homer the Whopper"", Comic Book Guy created the comic book series Everyman. He apparently created 278 issues, including the controversial issue with the death of Marmaduke. However, he was reluctant to self-publish them initially because he feared that he'd be mocked by the internet community for his comics. While trying to exasperate Comic Book Guy by feigning complete ignorance on the history of Spiderman, Bart and Milhouse stumbled upon a draft of an issue of Everyman that he was working on. Comic Book Guy then learned that Bart and Milhouse actually liked the comic, and after a bit of convincing, he decided to self-publish.
 The comic's popularity started to soar as a result, with a movie project starting for the Summer Market. Some movie executives requested to make Everyman into a movie. Comic Book Guy was reluctant to allow them to work with the movie, especially as the same movie company apparently ruined the Stratego movie for him. He eventually relented, but only under the condition that he picked the person who will portray Everyman. When they refused that condition, he opened the door to the store, implying that he wanted them to leave, until they agreed to that condition, commenting that being ""hard-balled by Hollywood"" is the closest thing to a physical sport that he could ever do.
 He later explains that he wants a ""complete loser"" to portray Everyman. He then picks Homer Simpson for the part, after the latter accidentally walked into the store, not realizing it was closed for auditioning. He then spent his time talking to people at his new, Hollywood-style house about what it is like to be a producer, and adopting a Cambodian Orphan named Prius. However, when the movie was going over budget and Homer ended up gaining an eating disorder due to his fitness coach abandoning him for Turtle (to the extent that he couldn't even get out of his trailer without it being sawed off), he tried to end production of the film, but ended up being thrown out by security into a dumpster with disgraced executives.
 He later ended up sacrificing any chance at another Everyman movie being made by voicing his honest opinion that the Everyman movie was the worst movie ever. It is unknown if he still worked on his comics after this.
 Comic Book Guy was once married—in an online role-playing game. He and his Internet wife contemplated having children, but that would have severely drained his power crystals. He was shown paired with Mindy Simmons, the woman who had briefly tempted Homer, during a mass-marriage that occurred when a cult took over Springfield, and presumably the two were wed in the mass ceremony.
 While part of an intellectual junta that briefly ran Springfield, he proposed plans to limit breeding to once every seven years (a reference to the Vulcan blood fever of mating, called Pon Farr), commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most, but for him, ""much, much more"".
 Comic Book Guy also has a cousin named Comic Book Gay, who is mustachioed and presumably homosexual. Comic Book Gay is interested in ""certain types of comics"" and sounds just like Comic Book Guy.
 Comic Book Guy with Agnes Skinner He was a virgin well into his forties when he became romantically involved with Principal Skinner's mother Agnes. Chief Wiggum and Eddie were notably repulsed when he and his officers stumbled upon the couple ""in the act,"" (having sex) with the former even quickly offering when arresting him for pirated videos that he'll reduce his sentence if he ""puts on some pants, fast!""
 He later dated Edna Krabappel and was shown with the Superman logo tattooed on his upper right buttock (which is interesting, as in the Comic Book Guy's Book of Pop Culture, he states that he hates Superman; it's possible that considering the location he doesn't consider this to be a compliment). 
 While at the Springfield Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con, Comic Book Guy meets a woman to whom he is attracted and asks, ""How do you feel about forty-five year old virgins who still live with their parents?"" However, this relationship does not progress any further when he refuses to comb the Sweet Tarts out of his beard.
 In the episode ""Married to the Blob"", he met and started dating Kumiko Nakamura, a Japanese mangaka. He later married her. In Season 32's ""The Dad-Feelings Limited"", Kumiko and him had been arguing on whether to have a baby or not. At the end of the episode they had decided to have a baby. However, Comic Book Guy has been shown many times since this scene and there has been no mention of a child.
 Comic Book Guy is a NPC passenger. Some destinations you drive him are to the Androids Dungeon, Willie’s Shack, and the Leftorium. He also provides commentary during the end-game credits, where he, predictably, makes scathing comments about the people who worked on the game.
 Comic Book Guy appears in a few missions. He first appears in the third mission of the second level, ""Vox Nerduli"" Bart asks him if he knows where Bart can get a copy of Bonestorm 2 but Comic Book Guy is more interested in being the first to register his complaint about the the new McBain film. (According to him the action was dismal and the nudity was frustratingly fleeting), however after Comic Book Guy and Bart race against a nerd to get to The Java Server, Comic Book Guy tells Bart that Professor Frink has purchased all the remaining copies of Bonestorm 2.
 He next appears in the first mission of the third level, ""Nerd Race Queen."" Lisa, trying to find Bart, tries to ask whether he had seen him. Comic Book Guy, however, is unwilling to answer her question, as he's more concerned with trying to get the last issue of the Itchy &amp; Scratchy Adventures comic (which, according to him, is a very controversial issue as the two finally kiss), and promises that he'll aid her in her dilemma if she can assist him. After getting it, Lisa asks whether he can tell her Bart's location now, but he insists that they return to the The Android's Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop in order to put the issue in a mylar bag before it ""deteriorates into near-mint condition."" Upon doing so, she then pressed the issue further, with Comic Book Guy then stating that he may have seen Bart at the Noise Land Video Arcade, and then states that video games are a waste of money, while he considers bidding $1,000 Itchy and Scratchy corn cob holders online to be a ""terrific, terrific expense.""
 He also appears as the bonus mission for the fourth level. In it, he asks for Marge's help in retrieving his gifts to Agnes Skinner from Springfield Elementary School due to Principal Skinner intercepting the gifts and locking them away there, presumably in an attempt to keep them apart, due to her refusing to go out to mock schoolchildren for this reason. He reluctantly admits that he can't do it by himself because his obvious lack of mobility due to his immense weight. When Marge, sympathizing with his being husky, asks for a favor from him in return for her helping him, he enthusiastically agrees to it. After retrieving her belongings (Two heart boxes that presumably contained chocolate, two sets of false teeth, two sets of heart underwear, a tombstone, and a pair of slippers), and after returning the ""laundry"", he then, after expressing joy at hearing Agnes' sneer again, keeps his end of the bargain by supplying her his phone number if she wants to hear his theories on how Krusty jumped the shark. Comic Book Guy drives a Gremlin, which can be used if selected.
 He later appears in the prelude to the second mission of the seventh level. When Homer meets up with Comic Book Guy (whom he refers to as ""Smelly Sam"") and asks what's going on, Comic Book Guy explains that the alien craft is using a tractor beam to suck up any trespassers to their doom, while maintaining they were horrible special effects despite it being real. Homer then asks about the black car, with Comic Book Guy explaining that, to his certain knowledge from Sci-fi movies, it is an advanced alien probe, and dismisses Homer since he wants to spend his last hours on Earth doing what he does best: Complain about movies on the internet. Homer then mutters that the gift of life was wasted on him. Comic Book Guy then advises that Homer buy a Zombie Car, as it would protect him from the zombies, although it comes at the cost of needing human brains to operate as a ""slight drawback"", with Homer quipping he's got ""plenty of those.""
 Comic Book Guy appears throughout the game to point out various video game cliches that the player can unlock by performing certain actions. Jeff tells Bart that the cave near the museum is the appropriate setting for a superhero origin story. He later thanks Bart for saving the museum. He later says that he won't lose in the eating contest especially not to Homer. He also appears as one of the contestants in the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge in the level Around the World in 80 Bites, and sadly deals with his defeat by snacking. He also berates Groundskeeper Willie for spoofing the end of Planet of the Apes in the ending to the aforementioned level while cleaning. He then tells Bart about The Loggers and tells Bart that it's cool that he saved the trees but it's not like they're Ents. Later he was playing Grand Theft Scratchy online and is defeated by Lewis. He says l that Aquaman has prevented dolphins from attacking the pier and gets emailed by LonleyMoe15 that Lard Lad is attacking the city and expects Zombies to attack the mall but it's aliens. He also appears in the form of a gang of sumo wrestlers (also cliched) in Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game. One of the Comic Book Guy sumo wrestlers make a final appearance in the Game Over level as one of the icons God uses to defeat the Simpsons as the family destroy his Hii.
 He had a cameo appearance in The Cleveland Show episode Hot Cocoa Bang Bang voiced by Hank Azaria, where he simply states ""Worst cameo ever"".
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror X"", Comic Book Guy, who has styled himself as a villain called ""The Collector,"" kidnaps Lucy Lawless thinking that she is Xena. He kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate. Lawless goes to remove the breastplate, but when hundreds of fans raise their cameras to photograph her breasts she stops with a statement of ""Maybe later."" He takes her to his lair, where he puts her in an aluminized Pet film bag for ""safekeeping"" and imprisons her in a room of other similarly-captured celebrities such as Yasmine Bleeth and Tom Baker. Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl burst into The Collector's hideout, but he manages to knock Clobber Girl out with a working phaser gun that was fired only once to prevent William Shatner from releasing another album. He wastes all his remaining shots on Stretch Dude, who splits in half and does somersaults to avoid the rays. The Collector hurls his empty raygun at Stretch Dude, hitting him on the forehead and knocking him out as well. He suspends the drowsy duo over a vat of bubbling Lucite, slowly lowering them towards certain doom and mocks them, saying ""Goodnight, Retch Dude and Slobber Girl. Sweet screams!"" Lucy Lawless, still in her plastic restraint, lures the Collector over by pretending to be attracted to him. When he's close enough she grabs his lips and then attacks him with Kung Fu moves. Stating that he fell for a ""ruse so hackneyed, it would make Stan Lee blush!"", the Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and ignites the blades. Lucy reminds him that he has removed it from its original packaging and it is now no longer a collectible. He backs away in horror and plummets into the Lucite, eventually emerging to strike a dramatic death pose (imitating a Lorne Greene pose from Battlestar Galactica) before the plastic hardens around him.
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XIV"", Jonathan Frink Sr. takes his butt, however he somehow survives this.
 In the final segment of the ""Treehouse of Horror XXIV"", he is seen as a snail during the closing credits.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XXVI"", he is listening to Kumiko in ""Homerzilla"".
 At The Android's Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop, Seamus and Collette pries the information on how to find Ned, threatening him, and after learning of his usual location, Comic Book Guy calls Fit-Fat Tony asking him why he wasn't protected like he pays for, and Fit-Fat Tony tells him he'll deal with him.
 Comic Book Guy is morbidly obese, has a slight stubble, and has a receding hairline. His hair is light brown and in a ponytail. He usually wears a blue short-sleeve shirt has does not fully fit over his stomach, red shorts, and blue shoes.
 Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles Amok book shop who often "" on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam containerful of fried clams with a lot of tartare sauce."" Matt Groening noted that: ""I can't tell you how many times people have come up to me and said, 'I know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' And I have to tell them, ""No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.""
Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name ""F"", and lived in the room next door at his college. Azaria also ""loves that the character is an adult who argues with kids as if they're his peers.""
 A long-running gag on the show was never to reveal the character's name, with other characters referring to him as ""Comic Book Guy"". Finally, in the February 6, 2005 episode, ""Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass"", Comic Book Guy nonchalantly told Ned, ""My name is Jeff Albertson, but everyone calls me 'Comic Book Guy'."" Showrunner Al Jean remarked, ""That was specifically done to make people really mad. We just tried to pick a generic name. It was also the Super Bowl show, so we did it so the most people possible would see it."" Groening stated that he had originally intended him to be called Louis Lane and be ""obsessed and tormented by"" Lois Lane, but was out of the room when the writers named him.
 Comic Book Guy's Book of Pop Culture Comic Book Guy has also been seen in quite a few episodes but he has had very few episodes where he is a major character. He is rarely seen outside The Android's Dungeon and most of his interactions are with Bart Simpson. Comic Book Guy wasn't seen very often early in the series of the show and has not been seen very much since in the 19th season.
 Even though Comic Book Guy is just a recurring character, he still has some merchandise such as, Comic Books Guy's Book of Pop Culture. He also appears on the cover of the twelfth season DVD, as well as having four action figures in the World of Springfield line, one coming with the Collectors Lair play set as the Collector, another coming with the Androids Dungeon play set, a Toyfare exclusive Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con Comic Book Guy, and ""Worst Episode Ever"" T-shirt Comic Book Guy. As part of Simpsons Comics, Comic Book Guy had his own mini comic series.

Mrs. Glick,False,False,False,True,False,2,stars,60,"Alice Glick lived in the Simpsons's neighborhood. Bart met her when he was trying to earn money to buy a collector's item comic book. Mrs. Glick put Bart to work doing chores around her house, but because she paid him very poorly, he quickly grew to loathe her. During one of Bart's work sessions with Mrs. Glick, she showed him ""an old lady thing"" where she dyed her wedding dress black for her husband's funeral.
 Doctor Hibbert confessed to once leaving his car keys inside her while operating. She also tried to sell a candy dish for ninety dollars that she forcefully insisted could only be used for storing candy. Mrs. Glick was shown at the Springfield Swap-and-Meet, selling many valuable items such as an original copy of the Declaration of Independence, the first Superman comic, Inverted Jenny postal stamps and a Stradivarius violin, all for five cents. Mrs. Glick once took the heart donor ticket off her I.D., along with many other people around her. Mrs. Glick is among the protesters outside the Immigration and Naturalization Service building with a sign that reads HOMER SAYS “GET OUT” that Homer had made. Mrs. Glick is walking along a downtown street with her groceries when she trips and falls upside down into a trash can.
 Alice was possibly suffering from dementia; consequently, her grasp on reality can be questioned at times. She also appears to not be aware of the times, having paid Bart 25 cents (a shadow of its former value) and living a solely archaic lifestyle to accompany it.
 When residents of Springfield were at the Kwik-E-Mart stocking up food for a hurricane, she grabbed Lisa's head, thinking she was a pineapple, and carried her on her shopping cart along with Ralph (whom she thought was a pumpkin). Ralph then revealed that Mrs. planned on cooking them into a pie.
 Alice Glick's death confirmed on the News Alice appears to have been one of the ladies who gets her hair done on a regular basis at the salon Marge goes to. Alice also watches soap operas. Alice also appears to be civic pride where Springfield is concerned, enjoying Jebediah Springfield Day.
 Mrs. Glick had a brother named Asa, who died during World War I. He was killed by his own grenade when he held onto it for too long.
 It is revealed that Alice was a long-time friend of Myrna Bellamy. However, given that Myrna Bellamy does not exist, but is a fictional character created for the reality show Frame Up, this could mean the show's producers either hired Mrs. Glick to be part of the cast or knew of her dementia and took advantage of it to get her to go along with the story. She also appears to be friendly with Agnes Skinner.
 Alice is killed in ""Replaceable You"" by a rogue robot seal. She is later seen in Heaven and as a Ghost. 
 Alice is seen sitting in the front row in ""The D'oh-cial Network"", despite having died in ""Replaceable You"". Following her debut in the episode ""Three Men and a Comic Book"", Alice became a recurring minor character, often seen at the hospital or the Springfield Retirement Castle. In addition to minor speaking roles, she also lingers in the background of various episodes, often laughing toothlessly. Groundskeeper Willie once even made a remark about it, quoting ""How come yer always around?!"", frightening Mrs. Glick.
 In her first appearance, Alice was voiced by Cloris Leachman. In all her appearances since then, she is voiced by Tress MacNeille.

Database,True,False,False,False,False,6,Hayden,62,"Tress MacNeille  Pamela Hayden Kyle Williams, better known as Database, is a student of Springfield Elementary and a member of The Superfriends.
 Like many nerds in Springfield Elementary, Database is a common target for Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. Database was part of the group of boys who rescued the Springfield Lemon Tree from Shelbyville  and was also part of the Pre-teen braves .  He is shown to be a comic book geek as he shows up at Comic Book Guy's store.  One time, he attended at Homer's Q&amp;A.  The other time was when he went to find a Batman action figure for his toy Batmobile.  Stan Lee asked him if he wanted an exciting action figure to fit in there, but Database said only Batman fits in there.  So, Stan decided to jam The Thing action figure in the toy car.  Database cries and declared that Stan broke his Batmobile.  But Stan said that he made it better instead of breaking it.
 In the DVD commentary for ""Lemon of Troy"", Matt Groening states that Database is his least favorite recurring character.
 Yeardley Smith has suggested that Database should be teamed up with Professor Frink.
 Database's father is shown in ""Lemon of Troy"", but he never speaks and is only in the background. He hasn't been seen since that episode.
 In later episodes, Database is occasionally voiced by Tress MacNeille.
 Database is loosely based on the androgynous character Pat who was created and performed by Julia Sweeney for Saturday Night Live.

Declan Desmond,True,False,False,False,False,14,stars,63,"Declan Desmond is an eccentric and skeptical British documentary filmmaker who has directed several films.
 he has a black sweater with a gray suit coat and gray pants he has a small pointy nose and his shoulder length red hair is tied back into a short ponytail 
 American Boneheads: A Day in the Life of Springfield Elementary is a documentary made by Declan Desmond where he interviews the children at Springfield Elementary.
 After Bart upstages Homer's role in the family, Homer is watching an unnamed lion documentary by Declan Desmond. It is about a middle-aged lion (who resembles Homer) who loses his place to a younger lion (who resembles Bart) and does not want to be in the pit with an older lion (who resembles Grandpa) and decides to spend more time with the cub (who resembles Lisa). This then influences Homer to spend more time with Lisa.
 Growing Up Springfield is his most notable documentary. It follows the lives of the inhabitants of Springfield, starting when they were in third grade and continuing every eight years. It is similar to Michael Apted’s Up! series.
 Other than his three major films in the series Declan has also made many minor films including Do You Want Lies With That? featured in 'Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky, and Ain't No Mountain High: A Blind Man Climbs Everest featured in Springfield Up. Also two other documentaries that he made where mentioned, the two being ""Lost Luggage, Shattered Lives"", ""Up-skirt Dreams"" and ""Do You Want Lies With That"".
 A documentary shown in Bart's class about the health risks of Krusty Burger. At the very beginning, Krusty the Clown complains about another documentary trying to make him look bad, hinting that this happens often. Declan Desmond probes this by eating nothing but Krusty Meals for a month. He gets so fat that his cholesterol oozes from his skin, he says ""That nothing else can transform him into a morbidly obese toilet busting American"" and he'll die if he doesn't have some type of nugget in him every five minutes. Krusty then picks him up in a fork lift saying ""You're going to be my breakfast English sausage!"" however only Declan's foot is made into a sausage. This gives Bart the idea of giving Nelson a month's supply of Krusty burgers and making him so fat he can't bully anyone.
 Desmond is unlocked alongside the Woosterfield Hotel.
 Declan is voiced by Eric Idle of Monty Python fame. Declan is also a British character and in Springfield Up Homer calls Declan ""Doctor Who""—a reference to his voice actor trying out for the role of the Eighth Doctor in the 1996 Doctor Who movie.
 He is based on real British filmmaker David Attenborough.
 He was added to The Simpsons: Tapped Out as part of the Level 55 Update.

Disco Stu,True,False,False,False,False,7,Azaria,64,"Stuart Discothèque, usually known as Disco Stu, is the owner of Stu's Disco. He is a disco aficionado and is usually featured wearing a rhinestone-encrusted leisure suit from the 70's and sports an Afro. He's the son of Doo-Wop Steve and Public Domain Debbie.
 He often refers to himself in the third person (putting a big emphasis on ""Stu"" and then pausing before saying anything else). He is also one of the many characters to have been married to Marge's older sister, Selma Bouvier, at one point (he was her fourth husband). In fact, Marge has gone so far as to claim that Stu is the only one of her sister's ex-husbands she liked (in ""The Real Housewives of Fat Tony""). While it's unknown how long Stu and Selma were married, he ended up getting an annulment for their marriage from Pope John Paul II (also revealing that Stu is Catholic).
 Before becoming a fan of disco, Stu was known as ""Nautical Stu"" due to his career as a sea captain before giving it up for his disco. Stu visited the neighborhood yard sale and turned down the chance to buy Homer's ""Disco Stu"" jacket. He has also been seen with goldfish in his platform shoes (which died) . And at one point he started to hit on Marge Simpson at the Ski Lodge (before being put off by her children).
 Although originally created as a throwaway gag character, Stu ended up being brought back again and again. Disco Stu has also been seen dancing with Homer after Homer discovers his love of walking, getting smashed by a jukebox thanks to a beefed-up Marge, and most recently, a regular on Homer's talk show.
 During a 'taxicab confession' in the episode ""How I Spent My Strummer Vacation,"" it's revealed that Stu's fully aware that disco is dead and admits that he doesn't even like the genre/culture anymore -- but after letting it define him for so long, Stu's worried that he's become a ""one note guy.""
 In Kozy Kabin's wood, there's a tree that has ""Homer + Marge 4ever"". There is ""Disco Stu + Disco"" too.
 In the episode ""Springfield Up"", it is revealed that in his younger years, he had a budding career as a sea captain, going by the name of ""Nautical Stu"", and only finds the joy of disco music when Marge puts some on while taking his picture for his captain's license. He said he is Super Christian. Also, he likes Edna very much.
 Stu runs his own nightclub and tried to start a franchise chain.
 Stu seems to have given up his obsession with disco thanks to Prof. John Frink's help in ""How I Wet Your Mother"". He calls himself ""Normal Stu"", wears modest slacks and a dress shirt, and says, ""Normal Stu likes normal things."" However, he is shown as Disco Stu again in ""The Man Who Grew Too Much"".
 Disco Stu has also appeared as ""Discus Stu"" in a parody of the Odyssey. He was ""Disco Shrew"" in the ""Treehouse of Horror XIII"" ""Dr. Moreau"" parody, where Stu was turned into a shrew, but wasn't worried about his condition. ""Big Band Stu"" appears in the parody of ""The War of the Worlds"" radio hoax that takes place in 1938, in ""Treehouse of Horror XVII"".
 In ""Days of Future Future"", Stu gets shock therapy at MovingOn where he becomes ""Nothing Stu"".
 He is addicted to sugar, consuming it in the manner one might cocaine in ""Sweets and Sour Marge"".
 In ""A Serious Flanders: Part One"", he is killed after Kostas Becker uses him as a human shield at Krusty Burger.
 He was originally going to be voiced by Phil Hartman in the episode ""Two Bad Neighbors"", but when the animators needed to do a model change, Phil wasn't available to re dub the voice, so Hank Azaria took it over.

Lunchlady Doris,False,False,False,True,False,3,MacNeille,65,"Doris Freedman (née Peterson) also known as Lunchlady Doris is an overweight, middle-aged, laconic and foulmouthed cafeteria chef at Springfield Elementary.
 Lunchlady Doris As the cafeteria chef at Springfield Elementary, she constantly prepares bad food, serving to students such appalling dishes as whole beef hearts, horse testicles, and shredded newspaper. During school cutbacks, she uses gym mats as a meat substitute, and other non-edible items .
 Due to the school's low funding, she also doubles as the school nurse. She was seen as a mail carrier .
 She has been implied to have a relationship with Groundskeeper Willie, and her son is Squeaky-Voiced Teen .
 
She once dated Hans Moleman. Ironically, all three characters debuted in the episode Principal Charming. Doris with Hans Moleman. She is a vegetarian and an insectivore, after serving beetle mash to Lisa, she revealed that a lot of vegetarians eat insects and that chocolate bars have bug parts added in accidentally, which made Lisa become an insectivore.
 She often smokes on the job, similar to Mrs. Krabappel and Miss Hoover.
 She was shown to be a member of the Big is Beautiful group and attended several of their protests and Albert's funeral.
 She is heard to be swearing a lot, and this has been further proven in the Bart Simpson Comics story, ""Lisa's Bad Word!"", where after Lisa has a bad day at school, she has to be Lunchlady Doris' assistant as punishment, but she keeps ordering Lisa the things she needs to do for her, accompanied with her swearing (which is censored due to censorship).
 She is 49 years old.
 After Doris Grau's death in 1995, Lunchlady Doris was retired out of respect for over 10 years. Due to the delay between recording some episodes and the time they actually air, archived audio files of Grau's voice were featured in ""Team Homer"" and ""Lisa's Sax"" because those episodes were made prior to her death. Lunchlady Doris then became a silent background character and was mostly been seen in crowds and groups of other faculty members. She didn't speak at all during her silent background character years and didn't speak again until Season 18, where she was voiced by Tress MacNeille and was also renamed as ""Lunchlady Dora"" in ""The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer"" to respect Doris Grau's death. She is currently voiced by Tress MacNeille since this episode.

Duffman,True,True,False,True,False,9,Azaria,66,"An elderly Duffman. Duffman, currently known as Puffman, was the mascot and spokesman for the Duff Beer company. His real name is either Barry Duffman or Barry Huffman. The idea of Duffman came about after H.K. Duff's grandfather repurposed a fascist icon because he could not get the rights to Woody Woodpecker. There are actually multiple people who play Duffman. (Others being Sid, Joe, and Larry)
 Duffman bobblehead Duffman is an athletic and smooth-talking corporate personality who wears blue and red tights, a red cape, white gloves, and the Duff logo emblazoned across his chest. The ensemble features a red hat with the Duff logo on it, dark sunglasses, and a ""utility belt"" of beer cans around his waist.
 Duff Beer logo Duffman is generally known for his overly enthusiastic speech in which he refers to himself in the third person, complete with dramatic pauses and ending with a suggestive ""Oh, yeah!"" and pelvic thrusts. Fittingly, his theme song which plays at every corporate-sponsored appearance is ""Oh Yeah"" by Swiss band Yello. Also, Lenny calls him ""the guy who creates an awareness of Duff"".
 Duffman is also a professional male stripper for private special events, such as Edna Krabappel's bachelorette party.
 Duffman is sober because of Duff Beer's policies.
 When Lenny mentioned that he had heard Duffman died of liver failure, Duffman scoffed ""Duffman can never die! Only the actors who play him!"" Duffman was also shot by Frank Grimes, Jr.. Duffman pledged his love to Doris before blacking out. Another Duffman possibly died when Moe (who had undergone plastic surgery thanks largely to his winning photo having to be ""censored"" due to his immensely deformed appearance) put a sticker on his face. Another Duffman was possibly killed in a blimp crash during a baseball game; it was then revealed that there were three Duffmen working the game that night The Duff corporation does not publicly acknowledge that Duffman is only a fictional character, so as not to disillusion Duffman's ""fans"". It was also implied by Homer Simpson that one Duffman who owned a set of blimp keys committed suicide via drowning because Homer wouldn't let him share a beer while both were skinny dipping.
 He is shown cleaning up Lake Springfield in The Simpsons Movie.
 Though he is a corporate mascot of Duff Beer, some actors have displayed independent thought and conscience at times. Homer discovers that H.K. Duff, who owns not only the beer company but also the Springfield Isotopes, was planning to move the team to Albuquerque. Commanded to help discredit Homer, this Duffman was torn between corporate loyalty, and the truth. In the end, Duffman said to himself ""New feelings brewing in Duffman! What would Jesus do?"" and tossed Howard Duff into the stands of Isotope Stadium (effectively throwing the money changers out of the temple).
 Duffman is friends with Rainier Wolfcastle, Cookie Kwan and Miss Springfield.
 Duffman claims to have two children, Dufflad and Duffgirl, but Mr. Duff VII retorts that these were ""one-time shots in a Super Bowl commercial"". This Duffman was named ""Sid"". When he was subsequently found teaching basic mathematics at the Springfield Men's Mission, he was played by ""Barry Duffman"". Also, Duffman said ""Are you there, God? It's me, Duffman!"". Duffman (or at least this particular Duffman) also mentioned, after distributing several Duff memorabilia that he has to leave early to comfort his and Grady's adopted and estranged daughter who dropped out of college.
 When Homer and Marge attended an Oktoberfest festival, Duffman, who was the host of the festival, energetically exclaims, ""Duffmensch orders you to party! This Reich will last a thousand beers! Oh, Ja!"", which is a reference to the Nazi concept of a Thousand Year Reich. He made lots of other German World War II references, which he hated because he is Jewish. So, he mutters under his breath, ""I do this, and I'm Jewish"".
 Duffman (or rather, whichever actor was playing him at the time) was revealed to be bisexual and in a long term stable relationship with Grady. He had a fling with Booberella revealed in a behind the scenes interview that was a publicity stunt.
 He was also revealed to be in love with Grady, who wanted to break up with Julio. (Grady calls Homer and says that he has found a new man, just as Duffman walks out of the shower and whips him with a towel)
 He married Grady in ""There's Something About Marrying"". (Not shown, but implied by the statement that Homer has married every gay couple in town, partway through the episode). They are most likely still together and their adopted and estranged daughter is mentioned in ""To Surveil With Love"".
 When Duffman is shot by Frank Grimes, Jr., he says, ""I love you, Doris!"".
 Duffman also slept with Titania. He promised her that in exchange for sleeping with him, she wouldn't have to touch the drunks in a bar-tending contest, but he reneged on the promise at the last minute.
 Duffman is revealed to have dyslexia, calling it ""Duffman's secret shame"". He also said that he has studied ballet for four years at Juilliard.
 Duffman appears in The Simpsons Game as the emcee of the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge in the level ""Around the World in 80 Bites"".
 In ""Days of Future Future"", Moe Szyslak is caring for Duffman at his old age.
 Duffman is based on Budweiser's former mascot, Bud Man. Duffman's catchphrase comes from the song ""Oh Yeah"" by Yello, which the producers say became extremely popular after Ferris Bueller's Day Off and many advertisers started using it. As a result, the writers felt that the song and phrase ""Oh yeah!"" would be suitable for Duffman. Duffman's thrusts were first acted out by Brad Bird. Duffman is the greatest womanizer - or so he says. He talks almost the same pattern like Captain Kirk from the original Star Trek.

Dr. Marvin Monroe,True,False,False,False,False,1,Shearer,68,"The therapist in his third appearance in ""Some Enchanted Evening"", season one, first appearance along with everybody who appeared in this episode in production order. Dr. Marvin Monroe was a local counselor who was for a long time considered to have passed on, until he returned, revealing to have ""been very sick.""
 Homer sold the family TV after seeing an ad for Dr. Monroe's Family Therapy Center during a boxing match at Moe's. The ad claimed ""family bliss or double your money back"". The Simpson family was asked to complete a series of tests, including drawing your worst fear of which everyone drew Homer, except Homer himself who drew a random doodle. Unable to reach the Simpson family, Monroe turned to the shock therapy method: the Simpsons were strapped in chairs with electrodes attached to them, and controls which they could use to shock other family members. However, it got out of hand and the whole town lost power.
 Having had all his other patients leave, Monroe threw out the Simpson family, paid them the money, and told them to never tell anyone they were there. With their money doubled, they purchased a new TV.
 Monroe was one of the doctors who studied Homer to figure out if he was the missing link after Homer was captured by Bigfoot hunters.
 Monroe hosted his own morning radio show on KBBL where he took calls from listeners and tried to help them with their problems.
 Monroe was a panel guest on Smartline discussing TV violence.
 Monroe's tombstone shown in ""Alone Again, Natura-Diddily"". The death of Marvin Monroe had been confirmed during 138th episode spectacular. This episode had revealed the death in the form of a question. ""Which popular Simpsons characters have died in the past year?"", to which the answer was "" If you said Bleeding Gums Murphy and doctor Marvin Monroe you are wrong, they were never popular."" He stopped appearing on TV and his business closed down. Many people in Springfield also believed him to be dead because several things had been named after him; Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital, and a school gym. His grave is also shown, however several years later he spontaneously appeared at Marge's book signing, buying a copy of her book, The Harpooned Heart. Marge, shocked to see him, exclaimed that she hadn't seen him in years. Dr. Monroe explained that he had ""been very sick"".
 
Marvin Monroe is overweight and bald with a thin, slightly messy beard. He has a more snout-like nose not uncommon in The Simpsons characters and wears glasses, a white t-shirt, a blue tie, blue pants, and grayish shoes. Dr. Monroe, as he appears in ""Diatribe of a Mad Housewife"". Monroe was (initially) retired in Season 7 because voicing the character strained Harry Shearer's throat and, eventually, the voice became too annoying for Matt Groening.

Richard Texan,True,True,False,False,True,5,Castellaneta,70,"Richard ""Rich"" Texan, also known as ""The Rich Texan"" and Senator Shady Bird Johnson, is a stereotypical rich, callous, but gregarious, business owner from Springfield. He wears a tan suit with a bolo tie and a white cowboy hat (which he wore on the day Kennedy was shot) and is in his 70s. He holds two guns at once.
 The Rich Texan has a fortune of 290 million dollars, although at one time he was worth more than 1000000000 dollars (he was once accepted into Billionaire Camp). He once owned a basketball team called the Austin Celtics, which he lost to Mr Burns in a card game. It is revealed that he often secretly mixed steroid with the cocaine consumed by the players to enhance their performance (a parody of the Boston Celtics) .
 He is an active member of the Springfield Republican Party and speaks with a heavy Texas drawl. In Season 5's ""$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)"" (the Rich Texan's debut), Homer addresses the Rich Texan as ""Senator"", although this was never mentioned again . He once owned a logging company and once attempted to cut down Springfield's tallest Redwood tree, until his company was destroyed by the gigantic tree after it slid down a hill . He also once owned all of Mr. Burns's possessions, when he won them in a bet . One of Richard's fondest dreams is to build the world's first drive-through humidor . He claims to also be a member of an unnamed group of oil tycoons who make foolish purchases, having bought a stained glass bathrobe and the world’s fattest racehorse.
 Richard always carried two revolvers, and he had a common habit of pulling them out and firing them into the air while yelling, ""Yee-haw!"" whenever he is happy or excited. He has been to jail at least once when one of his stray bullets hit a Texas Ranger and the police made him switch to blanks, but he noted that ""They just don't feel the same"" . He once held Homer and Moe at gunpoint, while forcing them to walk along with him after being tricked by the two. He once went over the top and lost his mind after doing something generous for Ned . In ""A Serious Flanders: Part One"", Johnson apparently owed millions of dollars. After begging for his life, he was shot dead by debt collectors after he was taken hostage and most of his body was dissolved except for his face.
 Richard revealed that he suffers from pogonophobia (the fear of beards and mustaches), the excuse he gives Homer for parking in a handicap spot; he then promptly shoots at least one man dressed as Santa Claus . He is also obsessive-compulsive and counts by stepping with his left leg 1-2-3-4 before firing his pistols .
 Richard stated that he enjoys moonlight walks on the beach.
 Richard's license plate reads ""NO SHAME"" .
 He also drills for oil, although he claims that he doesn't do it for profit, but instead uses it for his private use for dancing (which involves him yelling ""Yee-haw"" under an oil tower spraying oil and dancing a jig), which he demonstrates to Bart and Lisa when they accuse him of fracking.
 Richard Texan has a gay grandson  and a daughter named Paris Texan (who looks and acts like Paris Hilton, and whose name is a play on Paris, Texas) .

 Don Marion Anthony D'Amico, better known as Fat Tony, was the boss of the Springfield Mafia. He was a stereotypical Italian mafia boss. He had been behind several of Springfield’s criminal enterprises. His rackets included illegal gambling, cigarette and fireworks smuggling, bootlegging, fraud, and selling false IDs. He had also been seen bribing and making secret deals with Mayor Quimby.
 Fat Tony and his associates also conducted businesses and socialized in the Legitimate Businessman's Social Club. His mafia henchmen included Louie, Legs, Johnny Tightlips, Frankie the Squealer, Joey, and Jimmy the Snitch.
 Fat Tony seems to have a streak of sensitivity in both his personal and business life, which, for example, in the mafia’s brief cameo in the episode ""Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington,"" it’s revealed that Fat Tony loves the movie “The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,” as revealed by Johnny when the latter tells Louie, who asked in annoyance on why they have to watch it on the mafia’s private jet, that “The Boss  got a thing for the Ya-Yas.” while watching the aforementioned film on their private jet, and seated near them watching the movie, Fat Tony, while sobbing to the movie despite his tough mafia guy exterior, tearfully asks himself “Why was I born a man?”, and then blowing his nose on a pizza slice he was eating instead of his own white handkerchief he carries in his jacket pocket.
 On several occasions, Fat Tony has said something that begins as ominous mafia language, only to be proven innocent; One example is ""We are going for a ride.... By which I mean the carpool."" and ""Now who's ready to sleep with the fishes...? Because I brought this Finding Nemo bedspread."" This also led to some confusion among his fellow mafia members, such as the time when Troy McClure was involved in a scandal involving a sexual attraction to fishes, and he told his fellow gang members that he was ""Sleeping with the fishes."", causing them to misinterpret the meaning to Troy having died when he actually meant that Troy was literally sleeping with the fishes. Similarly, when disposing of dead bodies, he and the other members of the mafia often use euphemisms for the cadaver that sounds innocuous-sounding when dealing with law enforcement. This was showcased twice. In ""Mom and Pop Art,"" he, or rather, Louie, with Legs' help, disposed of a cadaver rolled up in a rug inside a Goodwill donation bin to dispose of the body, with Chief Wiggum inquiring what they're donating, claiming it was a ""Beanie baby."" Similarly in the movie, when the town of Springfield was trying to clean Lake Springfield, Fat Tony, before leaving with Legs and Louie when talked out of dumping at the lake by the police, mentioned that he will have to take his ""Yard trimmings"" elsewhere, although Lou (And allegedly Wiggum) suspected it was, in fact, a cadaver he, Legs, and Louie were going to dispose of.
 Fat Tony was born Marion Anthony D'Amico. He implied that he dreamed to work as either a pizza man, organ grinder, or leaning-tower maker, but his dreams ended up ruined at some point. He eventually got a job in the mafia and worked his way up from henchman to capo. Eventually, he married Anna Maria D'Amico and had a son named Michael D'Amico. Unfortunately, an enemy tried to shoot Fat Tony, but Anna Maria protected him by jumping in front and later dying, although Fat Tony would later claim she was ""Whacked of natural causes"" and even admitted that he would leave her flowers at her grave every Sunday.
 Fat Tony with his son Michael. Fat Tony was a widower. He had a wife named Anna Maria with her grave in Springfield Cemetery who was ""Whacked by natural causes."" Fat Tony has a son named Michael, who he planned to have followed in his footsteps as the leader of the Springfield Mafia. Following his death, it was revealed that he has a cousin named Fit Tony, who took Fat Tony's place running the Springfield Mafia, eventually becoming Fit-Fat Tony and finally, the new Fat Tony, due to overeating.
 Fat Tony’s death.  In ""Donnie Fatso,"" Fat Tony collapsed and died in Homer Simpson’s arms. His death was most likely caused by a heart attack or cardiac arrest due to overeating, as well as stress from being betrayed by Homer, who was working undercover for the FBI. He was then replaced by his cousin, Fit Tony, who eventually evolved just like his cousin into the new Fat Tony, after previously being both Fit Tony and Fit-Fat Tony in the process.
 Originally, Fat Tony was going to be voiced by Hank Azaria. However, since Fat Tony wasn't a very good drawing, Matt Groening decided to make a special guest voice do him. Sheldon Leonard was originally supposed to be the voice of Fat Tony, but they weren't able to get him, so they chose Joe Mantegna instead. In one DVD commentary, it is stated that Mantegna is so enamored with the character that he has forbidden to allow anyone else to voice Fat Tony; He even voiced him when the script only called for a couple of grunts. (""Sex, Pies, and Idiot Scrapes"") However, this didn't keep Phil Hartman from filling in for him on one occasion. (""A Fish Called Selma"") Mantegna even revealed in an interview that he stylized Fat Tony's voice, especially Fit-Fat Tony's voice, after his uncle's voice, because he wanted the character(s) to stand out from his original performance as Joey Zasa, the main antagonist in ""The Godfather Part III."" Fat Tony's facial design (As well as Fit-Fat Tony's facial design) was also inspired by Italian-American actor Paul Sorvino in ""Goodfellas.""
 Fat Tony is a pastiche of mobsters from movies and dramas, especially The Godfather franchise. (And in later seasons ""The Sopranos"") His nickname may be a reference to Black Tony, the Don of the fictional Stracci Family in ""The Godfather.""
 ""Moe Baby Blues"" featured several interesting references relating to Fat Tony. To entertain his subordinates to reboost Louie's confidence in "" out the Castellaneta Family,"" Fat Tony puts an orange slice in his mouth in imitation of Don Corleone from ""The Godfather."" Minutes later at Luigi's, Fat Tony, while crying with his gang, the Castellaneta Family, and President of the Italian-American Anti-Defamation League upon being touched by Maggie Simpson's innocence thanks to Moe Szyslak pointing it out in order to save her from getting accidentally shot to death in an attempted ""Italian-American-Mexican Standoff,"" tearfully responded to this, saying ""I ain't cried like this since I paid to see Godfather III."" (In which Mantegna, ironically, played the character Joey Zasa, one of the inspirations for Fat Tony, as mentioned above)
 His son's name is a reference to Michael Corleone from ""The Godfather.""
 His house strongly resembles that of Tony Montana's house in the movie Scarface.
 Fat Tony also bears similarities to notorious Chicago mobster Al Capone. (The city where Mantegna was, ironically, born and raised in)
 In ""Trilogy of Error,"" when Fat Tony revealed that Legs is an experienced mob doctor while reattaching Homer's thumb which Marge Simpson accidentally cut off earlier, he explained to Lisa Simpson that "" once pulled a slug out of  arm and inserted it into a stoolie's brain,"" indicating that Legs once removed a bullet from Fat Tony's arm and placed it in a murdered undercover police snitch victim's brain.
 Even Ralph Wiggum, while watching Michael walking by at school, admitted, via breaking the fourth wall, that Fat Tony once shot his father, Wiggum, by saying ""His daddy putted bullets in my daddy. My daddy had to potty in a bag."" (""The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer"")

 Maude Flanders was a major character of The Simpsons in the first 11 seasons, was the first wife of Ned Flanders, and the late mother of Todd and Rod Flanders.
 Maude and Ned homeless Maude was a devout Christian who once attended a Bible camp to learn how to be more judgmental, although she isn’t as preachy as her husband. She campaigned strongly against Itchy and Scratchy with Marge and often partnered with Helen Lovejoy as they protest against the ""evils"" in Springfield. She died after being struck by a barrage of shirts fired from t-shirt cannons at the Springfield Speedway in ""Alone Again, Natura-Diddily"".
 Although she spent much of her free time in prayer and reading the Bible, Maude was known to let her hair (and her neckline) down for the occasional dinner party at the home of the Simpsons (Maude's neighbors).
 Homer Simpson and Moe Szyslak both find her attractive as shown when  Moe made unnamed phone calls to her and Homer once ogled Maude's low-cut dress at a dinner party, which resulted in him and Marge going to marriage camp.
 Maude smiling Maude liked ficus plants, unflavored nonfat ice milk, and Newsweek Magazine. In one episode, when Marge was arrested for accidental shoplifting, Maude was one of the people who missed Marge’s treats during a bake sale.
 After her so called death, Marge was mildly surprised and concerned to discover Maude's three pairs of shoes as she believes this to have been a fetish.
 Maude getting hit by a T-shirt and falling to her death In 2000 episode ""Alone Again, Natura-Diddily"", Maude died after being knocked off a grandstand by several t-shirt cannons at the Springfield Speedway. The shirts had been meant to hit Homer, who wanted one of them. However, before the shirts could hit him, Homer noticed a bobby pin on the ground and bent over to pick it up. This caused Maude, who was returning to her seat behind Homer, to be struck instead, and fall off the grandstand to her death, at least a 20-foot drop. According to Homer's statement later in the episode, he had parked in the ambulance zone, which prevented any quick resuscitation.
 Her death crushed Ned and their sons, Todd and Rod, who, although used to some measure of hardship (their house getting destroyed) assumed they would always be together (the actual reason her character was killed off was due to a pay dispute between the actress who voiced her character and the show's producers) and they are still together since Maude can be seen next to Flanders in Take My Life, Please.
 Maude's Funeral. Apparently, Homer fell in her grave, which Ned mentioned. Reverend Lovejoy eulogized her as follows: ""In many ways, Maude Flanders was a supporting player in our lives. She didn't grab our attention with memorable catchphrases, or comical accents. But whether you noticed her or not, Maude was always there ... and we thought she always would be."" Though the episode aired in February 2000, the events appeared to take place before the winter meaning that the events probably took place before Winter 1999 and 2000.
 After her death, the grieving Ned Flanders and the Simpsons saw in her sketchbook a series of drawings that outlined a plan for a Christian-themed amusement park named ""Praiseland."" Realizing this park to be her so thought final dream, Ned acquired the defunct amusement park ""Storytime Village"" from Colonel Antoine ""Tex"" O'Hara (""The Rich Texan"") and, with the assistance of Homer and other townspeople, built and opened Praiseland. He memorialized Maude there with a statue of her and placed on its base a plaque bearing the phrase: ""She taught us the joy of shame and the shame of joy.""
 A Maude mask Praiseland sold Maude memorial items such as masks. Praiseland gained popularity among the residents of Springfield when they erroneously attributed to the statue of Maude the performance of miracles providing religious experiences. The religious experiences were actually hallucinations, caused by gas that was leaking from a gas line near the base of the statue (it was revealed that Springfield natural gas was actually deadlier and more poisonous in area with good ventilation). Feeling that profiting off the memory of his thought to be dead wife was wrong, and even more so after the candles near the gas leak nearly caused an explosion, Ned closed down Praiseland.
 Maude in Heaven She was often seen with Helen Lovejoy, with whom she would protest against the evils of Springfield. After her death in Season 11, Helen is often seen with Luann Van Houten and Bernice Hibbert.
 Note: Maude is mainly a background character, episodes in which she has a speaking role are in bold.

Rod Flanders,True,False,False,False,False,1,Cartwright,74,"Rodney ""Rod"" Flanders is the oldest son of Ned Flanders and Maude Flanders and a stepson to Edna Krabappel. He has curly hair, light blue polo shirt, dark blue pants and gray shoes.
 Rod often prays, first thing in the morning and last thing before going to bed. He prays for God to watch over him and his little brother, Todd. He prays for the success of his father's business. He also prays for the success of all Christians, but due to his upbringing does not respect people of other (or no) faiths. Aside from praying, Rod enjoys playing with Todd and eating lots of ""Nachos, Flanders-Style"" (cucumbers with cottage cheese). His one regret is that he can't pray at school.
 Rod's favorite songs are ""Bringing In The Sheaves"" (followed closely by ""Noah And The Arky-Arky"") and ""I've Got The Joy, Joy, Joy, Joy Down In My Heart.""
 Rod has type 1 diabetes and has described being quiet during trips as one of his favorite hobbies (including clapping during songs).
 Rod, like his parents, is very religious; much more religious than his younger brother Todd, who’s often the only Flanders member to question their faith. He enjoys attending church, reading Bible stories, watching religious cartoons and playing religious-themed board games. These games include Good Samaritan - though they don’t use dice because Ned says that dice are wicked. Instead they just move one space at a time - he believes ""It's less fun that way"", and Billy Graham's Bible Blaster, a video game in which players try to ""convert the heathens"" by firing bibles at them. It cheered him and Todd up when their mother died.
 Ned prohibits them consuming foods containing sugar, as he fears it will make them behave badly, in which it does or send them into diabetic shock. He is also extremely entomophobic (particularly with moths and ladybugs), a behavior probably learned from their father, who considers an insect flying near someone a ""bug attack"". They enjoy stories about robots named Rod and Todd, though these also frighten them. He was also scared by Todd's 'Rod' mask. He claims he's envious/jealous of girls because they get to wear dresses.
 Rod obtained new climbing skills and rescued Bart from a gorilla atop a church. Rod thought of Marge as the most fun they've ever had ever since Maude died.
 On the episode ""Bart Sells His Soul"", Rod and family were at ""Moe's Family Feedbag"" celebrating his 10th birthday, making him the same age as Bart Simpson.
 Rod prays. He prays first thing in the morning and last thing before bed. He prays for God to watch over him and his little brother, Todd. He prays for the success of his father's business. He also prays for all the naughty little boys and girls, like Bart Simpson, who are too bad to pray for themselves. Aside from praying, Rod enjoys playing wholesomely with his brother and eating lots of nachos Flanders-style (""That's cucumbers with cottage cheese!""). His one regret is that he cannot pray at school.
 There is also some controversy as to which of the two is the elder. In ""Dead Putting Society"" the commentator at the golf tournament states that Todd is 8. In Homer Badman, one of the corrections that the TV-magazine show Rock Bottom makes is to their claim that ""the older Flanders boy is Todd, not Rod"" (although this could have been included purely to stir up fans). Later, in Bart Sells His Soul, the Flanders family eats out for Rod's ""big ten-oh"", suggesting the two are of similar age. However, the present time in at least one other Simpsons episode has been set two years before that of others, as shown by All's Fair in Oven War.
 In ""My Sister, My Sitter"" Lisa, when babysitting Rod and Todd, tells a story about a robot named Todd who ""had a brother named Rod, who was two space years older"", suggesting that Rod is 10. Todd responds by saying, ""I don't like this story!""
 As Rod is shown to be quite a bit bigger and taller than Todd, the claim that Todd is the older brother is disputed. Rod and Todd were both born before Lisa (who is 8). Todd appearing a younger age than Bart (who is 10) in the episode ""Lisa's First Word"" (when Bart was entering ""the terrible twos"").
 Despite these discrepancies, the Simpsons official website states that “Todd is the youngest and most impressionable member of the happy Flanders clan”. This seems to trump any inconsistency concerning age seen in the episodes. On the other hand, the character profile for Rod Flanders in the book ""The Simpsons: A Complete Guide To Our Favorite Family"" describes him as the ""youngest of the Springfield Flanders"", but they have made some mistakes in that book. Another possible reason for the variation is that, in the DVD commentaries for show, the writers have stated that they are never sure which Flanders sibling is Rod and which one is Todd and are often forced to check character models to be sure. According to the commentary, early show writers used two different mnemonics to identify the taller brother: Todd started with a T and was taller, or Rod was long like a rod and hence taller.
 At age 40, Rod, with his brother, Todd, is a cross-dressing lounge singer. They live with their father, who uses his pension to pay for their estrogen treatments. At age 40, he and Todd still live with Ned and take care of him because his eyes fell out.
 Rod appears along with his brother Todd Flanders and Ralph Wiggum as Hobbit-like children who help Homer and Marge defeat the two-headed dragon in order to get the Keycard.

Joe Quimby,True,False,False,True,True,2,Castellaneta,75,"Relative of unknown relation: Robert F. Quimby Jr. Joseph Fitzgerald O'Malley Fitzpatrick Culverstone O'Donnell The Edge ""Diamond Joe"" Quimby Jr., better known as Mayor Quimby, or just Joe Quimby, is the mayor of Springfield, Springfield's State. He appears as a slick, opportunistic politician whose chief priorities seem to be keeping himself in office, womanizing, and various other forms of corruption, including embezzling tax money, taking bribes from Fat Tony, the local Mafia Don, and giving monthly kickbacks to the equally corrupt Chief Wiggum. The seal on the wall of his office reads ""Corruptus in Extremis,"" which is Latin for ""corrupt in the extreme."" He speaks with a peculiar stutter.
 
Despite being mayor for such a long time (having at least six terms under his belt according to Birch Barlow), Quimby does not know or care much about his city, often privately (or even publicly) showing his outright contempt for Springfield's citizens. He frequently takes overseas vacations, which take him out of town for extended periods of time, leading to the headline ""Mayor Visits City"" in the Springfield Shopper. He once referred to Springfield as Sprungfeld at a public meeting. However, he makes frequent, albeit short, public appearances for local festivities, events, business openings, etc.  Mayor Quimby with Homer Simpson in ""Mayored to the Mob"" Among other corrupt behaviors he displayed while in office was his frequently accepting bribes from the mafia and other groups. His constantly accepting and securing bribes from unsavory people while in office was notorious enough that when he declared while shutting down Fat Tony's rat-milking operation that ""the Mayor's office is not for sale"", the reporters proceeded to laugh at him, apparently the irony of his statement not being lost on them, causing him to request and fail to have the laughter edited out. Aside from bribery, Barlow when describing him also inferred that he was also a tax cheat.
 If bending the law will suit Quimby's purposes, he will likely do so. He once arranged Marge Simpson's release after she was arrested for blocking traffic on a bridge after suffering a nervous breakdown, claiming that if she went to jail, Quimby could kiss the ""chick vote"" goodbye meaning all the women in Springfield would hate him and no longer vote for him since Marge's reason for blocking the traffic was understandable. He also resorted to bribing witnesses when assault charges were brought against his nephew, leading Bart Simpson to observe that ""the system works: just ask Claus Von Bülow"". He was once implied to have stolen picnic baskets. He is also willing to do corrupt things when he is confident that he would not get caught. A notable instance of this is when he funneled funds and cement mixing intended for road work to be used to create his swimming pool (which is shown as a lavish, almost Romanesque design) and maintained this secret despite rumors to it existing until Mr. X leaked the rumor onto his website and the press confirmed the rumor upon questioning Quimby after noticing him subtly telling a guard to close the ajar door to the pool.
 He also smoked marijuana, with Birch Barlow apparently being familiar enough with his marijuana addiction to describe him as, among other things, a pot smoker, with Quimby also tending a cannabis plant during that time. According to Birch Barlow, he apparently was also illiterate, although Quimby claimed that he no longer was that.
 Despite his vices and general self-serving use of the law, he has at times attempted to utilize the law for the greater good of Springfield, such as enacting ""Code Black"" to clean up Lake Springfield, as well as the (albeit largely ignored) establishing of a 75 cent toll booth in order to gain enough tax money to ""de-python the town fountain."" In another time, during a St. Patrick's Day, knowing how alcohol makes people violent in the city, he PROHIBITS alcoholic drinks that day in order not to be held responsible for any incident (unfortunately, the plan backfired due the participation of actual Irish Catholics and Protestants caused havoc in Springfield anyway because, without the alcohol, they were unable to forget their differences). He also at one point sacrificed television to save Springfield after Sideshow Bob threatened to detonate a nuclear bomb if they didn't end television.
 His catchphrase is ""Vote Quimby"", which he always finds an opportunity to say, even in situations where it would be disadvantageous to identify himself, like inadvertently being caught by Homer in a motel room with his mistress.
 When he was young, he was at fat camp named ""Camp Flab-Away"" along with Jeffery Albertson, Homer and other characters.
 Quimby is also extremely unfaithful to his wife, often womanizing and having extra-marital affairs with women who aren't his wife (especially Miss Springfield). Ironically, he actually did attempt to spend quality time with his wife when his life was threatened by Fat Tony after he (albeit forced to by Homer, his bodyguard) shut down his rat milking operation when Homer tried to invite him out to avoid concerns about the mob. It is implied that he does womanizing because he wasn't happy that he married Martha Quimby, as when doing the above of insisting he wants to spend time with her, he pauses and gives a disappointed sigh before saying ""wife.""
 According to Fat Tony when plotting Quimby's assassination, Quimby owned at least one cat and dog, whom the mobster initially considered targeting for assassination alongside Quimby himself and his wife, although he ultimately settled on just Quimby being assassinated due to Louie being unable to jot down his list in full.
 
Quimby was elected Mayor of Springfield in 1986 (even though in 1990's Homer's Odyssey, there was another mayor). He has been re-elected several times since, despite rather open admissions of fraud and wrongdoing. He once admitted to using taxpayer dollars to fund the murder of his enemies, but thanks to a clever use of a popular catch phrase (""I'm a bad wittle boy""), he was re-elected in a landslide, despite the implication that he still is doing so. Further evidence of his apparent political ideology, Quimby has earned himself the hatred of Springfield's small but vocal Republican elite, themselves portrayed (according to the show's writers and series creator Matt Groening) as mostly dark, ghoulish figures who meet in a castle.  Vote Quimby When the party nominated Sideshow Bob as its mayoral candidate, Bob rigged the election, briefly deposing Quimby. He was re-instated when Bob was found guilty of fraud and imprisoned. He also survived a recall election in 2005, with no candidate in the race against him (candidates included Rainier Wolfcastle (another Schwarzenegger reference), Kent Brockman and even Homer Simpson) garnering the 5% necessary to force a recall since Homer who had the majority of votes was kicked from the election.
 He was replaced by Snowball II for a brief period, until she fell asleep during the British Invasion of Springfield.
 In ""White Christmas Blues"", Quimby called the Springfieldians idiots, which leads to Lenny and Carl saying ""Why did we re-elect this mayor?"", which occurred because the other candidate had a very long last name.
 Understanding the need to adapt to modern times, Quimby implemented a series of ""go green"" projects. One of them, the refurbishing of the city’s famous monorail track, was disastrous, leading to him losing re-election in ""The Old Blue Mayor She Ain't What She Used to Be"" to Marge Simpson. After this exit from the Mayorship once again, however, Quimby became a private citizen in order to spend an unprecedented amount of time with his wife and children. Four years later, Quimby successfully ran for an open seat on city council, the same year Marge Simpson won re-election. Quimby was then appointed President of the City Council. A series of complicated scandals and gaffes then led to Marge being impeached; with Quimby next in the line of succession, he returned to the mayoral office.
 Joe in front of Wall of Fame He is shown to be a womanizer and has cheated on his wife with many other women. In ""She Used to Be My Girl"", that number was revealed to be twenty-seven different women though the number may have been increased when the series went on. His womanizing ways were such that, while giving then-recently hired Bodyguard Homer Simpson a pep talk on serving in a matter befitting the office of the Mayor, he ordered Homer upon seeing a busty redhead walking by to honk his horn, with Homer doing so and Quimby then giving a sex whistle to her (to her shock and disgust), as well as delaying being saved by Homer Simpson to flirt with an intern currently using the restroom from the window (as well as implying that this was how FDR met Eleanor Roosevelt) before being slapped twice. His womanizing extended even to family members, as he had his own niece act as a lover, and was only reminded of this fact when he told her to act as if she were his niece to act inconspicuous, causing him to refer to himself as an abomination in disgust.
 Some of the women became pregnant and later gave birth. In ""And Maggie Makes Three"", Quimby is seen in the hospital with one of the women, holding their baby, as well as panicking when the nursemaid (referring to the baby's mother) suggested he let his wife hold it, the staff clearly being unaware that the woman was not actually his wife. Cookie Kwan even gave birth to their son.
 In ""The Old Blue Mayor She Ain't What She Used to Be"", when Joe Quimby was not mayor he notice he is actually attract to his wife on the first night out of office which shows that his position as Mayor may have contribute to him being a womaniser.
 Joe Quimby has shown him with different woman at different events and place like the Jellyfish Festival cotillion where he danced with a woman who is not his wife, at a improv performance where he was in the audience with 2 women etc.
 His womanising ways was shown constantly throughout the series like he tried to give Lady Gaga a key card to his hotel room, he was shown at motels with women who are not his wife though he was constantly was with Miss Springfield, he tried to get a few of the Springfield Atomettes to be his mistresses etc.
 He had acknowledge his problems with his womanising ways like he admitted that he can't commit to a relationship at a Brad Goodman lecture, he attended a Sex Addicts Anonymous session with Bumblebee Man, Manacek, Disco Stu and Rainier Wolfcastle etc.
 Mayor Quimby becoming and being a womaniser may have happened because of his father who was also a womaniser as well.
 In “Lisa's Wedding”, he is later seen as a taxi driver under the employ of Otto Mann. It's implied in the episode that he was thrown out of office, and he has to try to deflect the embarrassment and shame of the event by falsifying his driver's license by claiming that his name is Mohammad Jafar.
 Joe Quimby appears mostly in the cut scenes of the level Mob Rules as he shares a hot-tub and some interns with the EA Games executive in order to receive his bribe to have Grand Theft Scratchy be sold to minors. When the EA Games executive sees a senator among the mob created by Marge protesting the sale of the game outside City Hall, he takes back the bribe, forcing Quimby to ban the sale of the game.
 In the game, when you reach level 20, you can build Town Hall. Upon completion, Quimby comes to stay in your town.
 Icon Quimby in the game Quimby zombie Joe Quimby's name partly comes from NW Quimby Street in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of show creator Matt Groening. The rest of the character's name is from Portland mobster and chief of police, ""Diamond"" Jim Purcell.
 
There are many things about Quimby and his family that are similar to Ted Kennedy and  Joe smiling the Kennedy political family such as:
 During the USAToday.com contest to choose which Springfield would host the Simpsons Movie premiere, Ted Kennedy himself appears in a video in which he invited ""Diamond Joe"" Quimby to Springfield, Massachusetts, and even mocked his own oft-mocked pronunciation of the word ""Chowder"" (as ""Chow-Dah"").
 In addition to the clear Kennedy connection, Quimby also has similarities with Charles Foster Kane, including having built an opera house for his girlfriend.

Gino Terwilliger,True,False,False,False,False,17,MacNeille,77,"Gino Underdunk Terwilliger is the toddler son of Sideshow Bob and Francesca Terwilliger.
 He appears almost exactly and speaks quite like his father, but with an Italian accent. His hair looks similar to Sideshow Bob's hair (resembling a palm tree). He looks like a toddler version of his father, but his feet are smaller. He also shares his father's hatred towards rakes and Bart Simpson.
 Gino with a knife Gino was born in the Italian village of Salsiccia to Bob Terwilliger (a.k.a. Sideshow Bob, who sought a new life as mayor of the village) and Francesca Terwilliger. When Sideshow Bob's life was ruined by The Simpsons, he followed Sideshow Bob and Francesca as they tracked the Simpsons down in Rome. He, along with his mother, helped Bob to try to kill the Simpsons. After Krusty saves the Simpsons family, he chases a butterfly.
 According to Sideshow Bob, he and his family fled to England where Bob got a job as a chimney brush after they had failed to kill the Simpsons in Rome due to Krusty saving them. He and his family tour around England going to Buckingham Palace, Sherlock's museum, and rowing a boat (Gino is seen using a megaphone telling his parents to row). Eventually, Bob, Francesca, and Gino sneak back to the US on a train. Gino and the rest of his family constructed a trap to kill the Simpsons by building a phony barbecue restaurant and constructing a commercial for it.
 After Sideshow Bob and his family hatch an ultimate plan to kill Bart Simpson but failed, Gino and his family were caught and thrown into prison together.

Frankie the Squealer,True,False,False,True,False,12,Castellaneta,78,"Frankie the Squealer is a married, low-level member of the Springfield Mafia and an associate of Fat Tony, then later, Fit-Fat Tony. 
 Frankie is known, as his name suggests, for his indiscretion. His squealing was so uncontrollable that he even managed to rat himself out occasionally. He is also similar to the other mafia member, Jimmy the Snitch.
 It is implied that he often ends up tortured specifically to shut him up for his indiscretion: While being beaten by Legs and Louie in an attempt to get him to shut up, he tells them Fat Tony's real name is Marion, so they resume the beating. The Springfield Mafia, incompetent as they are, continue to retain Frankie's services, even as he continues to be attacked, kidnapped, and poorly treated for his apparent continuing problem with keeping secrets.
 Despite this, however, his uncontrollable urge to commit indiscretion has also aided the mafia as well, as he informed Legs and Louie of Homer Simpson as the culprit behind the shootings at the mafia summit while pursuing him with guns.
 Frankie has short slicked grayish brown hair and wears a teal green jacket-like suit, a purple button-up shirt, and has a gold chain necklace with a small gold circular pendant around his neck, and short brown hair. In his debut episode, ""Insane Clown Poppy,"" he, like Johnny Tightlips, had a darker shade of yellow skin, then afterwards, starting in Season 16, his skin color is a normal yellow coloration instead.
 Frankie seems to be a nervous and skittish person. He obviously can't keep secrets, such as Fat Tony's real name. He can't help squealing because, according to himself, it makes him feel big.
 He ironically seems to be on good terms with Legs, as they both were seen having lunch at Luigi's in ""Penny-Wiseguys.""
 In ""The Fat Blue Line,"" he and the other members of the mafia originally had Johnny as his boss instead after the latter temporally betrayed Fit-Fat Tony by framing him for the wallet pickpocketing, but after Fit-Fat Tony cleared his name and exposed Johnny as the real pickpocket with the police's help after he forced Frankie to squeal on Johnny in front of him and the mafia so the police can hear it on Fit-Fat Tony's hidden wire, Frankie then eventually reaccepted Fit-Fat Tony as his boss again along with the other members of the mafia.
 In one of his cameo appearances in ""I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say D'oh,"" he, along with Homer and Maggie Simpson and even Johnny and his daughter, was attending a Daddy and Me class with his son.
 In another one of his cameo appearances in ""Diary Queen,"" Frankie shouted to his fellow mafia members that he isn't dead after they dumped his body in a river, resulting Johnny to pull his gun out and shoot at Frankie when Frankie attempted to swim away after shouting to the mafia members.

Johnny Tightlips,True,True,False,False,True,12,Azaria,79,"Johnny Tightlips (born Giovanni Silencio), also known by his legal name, Jonathan Schmallippe,is a frequently appearing mobster and the second-in-command of his old boss Fat Tony, as well as his new current boss, Fit-Fat Tony.
 Johnny is presumably in his 30s, and he works for the D'Amico Crime Family. He is a capo alongside Legs and Louie.
 He has a grandmother (Who he affectionately calls ""Granny"") and mother. Although in ""Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge,” when Fat Tony asked Johnny how his mother is, he reticently exclaims and then says “Oo-whee, who says I have a mother?"".
 Johnny has short black wavy hair that is receding, thick black eyebrows, shifty eyes, and wears a purple suit, a pale purple shirt with dark purple pinstripes, a light purple necktie, purple pants, and dark purple shoes. In ""Insane Clown Poppy"" and ""Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge,” Johnny's skin color had a darker shade of yellow, then starting in Season 14, his skin is instead a normal yellow coloration. Also, the pinstripe linings on his shirt, his shirt’s sleeve rims underneath his suit’s sleeve rims, and even his eyebrows sometimes disappear and reappear in different shots in some episodes.
 Johnny is obviously very stoic and anti-social. He’s shown to be more focused on the mafia’s functioning in recent episodes. Fit-Fat Tony even complained once that he’s not really good at reading emotions. He is fairly mean to fellow mobsters such as Louie and Dan Gillick. 
 Even in his cameo appearance in ""I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say D'oh,” he is seen attending with his unnamed infant daughter, alongside Frankie the Squealer and his unnamed infant son, the same Daddy and Me class (A class for fathers and their babies) that Homer Simpson attended with Maggie Simpson, revealing that he and Frankie, like Fat Tony with Michael D'Amico, (As well as Legs and Louie with Calves and Louie Jr. respectively in the comics) are fathers as well. It was even hinted from his experience with his daughter in ""A Made Maggie"" that he does have a soft side for baby and child stuff when he was helping Fit-Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie open the Bambino Depot at the Springfield Mall when he secretly showed a soft side towards a teddy bear while smiling tenderly at it, only to quickly cast it aside gently and resuming his tough guy role. He was also keen on coloring in a coloring book for Ned Flanders to reduce stress in “The Many Saints of Springfield.”
 Johnny first appeared in ""Insane Clown Poppy,” where he is at a mafia meeting. Later in the episode, he gets shot. When Louie asks him questions out of concern for him, he dodges them automatically.
 His second appearance is in “Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge,” where he and his three other goons (Whom Fat Tony referred to as "" Joisey  muscle."") go with Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie to the Simpsons’ house in an attempt to kill Homer out of revenge for his business, SpringShield, busting Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie for trying to illegally sell some ferrets disguised as toy poodles. Homer is then supported by a mysterious sniper, (Secretly revealed to be Maggie saving Homer from the mafia's wrath) Fat Tony asks Johnny if he can see the said mysterious sniper, resulting Johnny to just say that "" see a lotta things."" They all get shot by Maggie, which they didn’t know, and then, offscreen, arrested by Chief Wiggum, who got his job as a police chief back after Homer decides to quit and end SpringShield due to him almost getting killed by the mafia for it.
 The only two times he ever got emotional were in ""Moe Baby Blues"" when he broke down crying along with Fat Tony's gang, the Castellaneta Family, and President of the Italian-American Anti-Defamation League upon being touched by Maggie's innocence that Moe Szyslak pointed out when the latter saved her from an ""Italian-American-Mexican Standoff"" at Luigi's by pointing out how her innocence changed his life before, and in “Top Goon,” when he, Legs, and Louie, upon being touched by Moe’s kind speech to Nelson Muntz, even to the extent of Johnny pulling a piece of bologna to wipe a tear away like a handkerchief, confide to Fit-Fat Tony about their relationship with him and how he sees them as weapons, which makes the three capos break down crying at the revelation.
 In ""The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer,"" he, while visiting an unconscious recuperating Fat Tony at the hospital after their rival mobsters, the Calabresis, shot him down with some non-fatal gunshot wounds, actually showed some concern for Fat Tony, admitting that if the Calabresis aren't taken care of, they will put the unconscious recuperating Fat Tony, who is going through a ""Morphine mambo,"" in a ""Dirt nap."" He then later casually comforted Fat Tony’s son, Michael, by encouraging him to temporally take his father's place as the mafia’s don until Fat Tony is better. He then, a few seconds later, also, in bitter annoyance, described to Louie in his face that he is a ""Hybrid; Half idiot, half moron."", when Louie asked about going to try out a new car hybrid at the Lexus dealership on the way back to the Legitimate Businessman's Social Club.
 In ""Waverly Hills 9-0-2-1-D'oh,"" it’s revealed that, upon learning from Wiggum that Batman will be at his son, Ralph Wiggum’s, birthday party, Johnny, along with Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie, is terrified of Batman, admitting that "" ain’t messing with no caped crusader!”, due to the fact that Batman would beat a villain up for a confession.
 In their brief cameo in ""Rednecks and Broomsticks,"" Frankie admitted that Johnny has a bad back while Johnny, Legs, and Louie were forcing Frankie to dig his own grave in the woods when Johnny suggested that he, himself, will dig Frankie's grave for him in a threatening way.
 In ""What to Expect When Bart's Expecting,"" upon finding out that Bart Simpson had helped successfully impregnated Fit-Fat Tony’s horse with an unborn male foal with Homer’s help within 24 hours upon the two's abduction by the mafia, despite Louie happily and cluelessly pointing out how happy Johnny is at the good news, he is, deep down, pleased with the rest of the mafia who happily responded to those good news, yet he was the only one who didn't actually smile on the outside.
 Homer even mentioned to Dan, in order to ""Convince"" the latter to spare Johnny and the mafia members he was ordered to ""Rub out"" by Fit-Fat Tony, that Johnny digs wells while, at his spare times, vacationing in Darfur, indicating that Johnny, despite being a criminal mobster, also shows an altruistic side at times when it comes to charity work. (Although Dan had already asked Homer to stop him from killing Johnny and the other mobsters) (""Penny-Wiseguys"")
 Although very reticent and laconic, and at times altruistic, that doesn't mean he isn't treacherous, as Fit-Fat Tony learned the hard way when Johnny framed Fit-Fat Tony for pickpocketing wallets and set Fit-Fat Tony up into walking into a warehouse storing them, and what gave him the confidence to betray Fit-Fat Tony by framing him and becoming the new boss is taking some Paxil, which is also his confidence-boosting medication. But after Fit-Fat Tony cleared his name and exposed Johnny as the real wallet pickpocket with the police's help, Johnny was then arrested after he accidentally almost killed Homer by accidentally shooting him in his rear when Johnny meant to shoot Fit-Fat Tony. Afterwards, Johnny, for unknown reasons, ended up being reaccepted back as Fit-Fat Tony's capo again after being released from jail. (Probably because Fit-Fat Tony admitted earlier in the same episode that he trusts Johnny, and he, offscreen, probably decided, along with the other mafia members who also reaccepted Fit-Fat Tony as their boss again, to forgive Johnny for his actions against Fit-Fat Tony) (“The Fat Blue Line”) 
 In his cameo appearance in ""Diary Queen,"" when Louie asked Fit-Fat Tony if he, Legs, and Johnny can kill Bart and Milhouse Van Houten upon spotting them seeing them dump Frankie’s body into the river, Fit-Fat Tony told them no because they don't kill nosy children unless they are 18 years old or over. Also just before that moment, Frankie shouts to his fellow mafia members that he isn't dead, resulting Johnny to pull his gun out and shoot at Frankie when Frankie attempted to swim away after shouting to the mafia members.
 In ""A Made Maggie,"" Johnny attempted to betray Fit-Fat Tony again by killing him out of jealousy when he noticed how soft his boss has become to Maggie, as well as spending more time with her and her family instead of the mafia, ever since Fit-Fat Tony became her godfather under Homer's request by Marge Simpson’s request. There, Johnny makes a deal with Don Castellaneta and his mafia to get rid of Fit-Fat Tony at the ""Itchy and Scratchy's Christmas on Ice"" presentation, and even attempted to bribe Legs and Louie into helping him out on this. However, Legs and Louie, in the end, end up saving Fit-Fat Tony from that fate instead by restraining Johnny on the ice rink, both of them admitting that Fit-Fat Tony is considered their ""Cousin,"" and Fit-Fat Tony ends up punishing Johnny for attempted second betrayal by punching him right in front of Maggie and her family, resulting the Simpsons and Fit-Fat Tony to decide that Fit-Fat Tony would be better off not being Maggie's godfather that Marge wanted.
 In “Top Goon,” the mafia (Including him) accepts Nelson as one of them. Later in the episode, he, along with the other capos, take guard as Nelson goes to punish King Toot. Moe quickly comes to intervene, and while his speech moves Johnny to tears, this also makes the capos open up about their relationships with Fit-Fat Tony, and that Fit-Fat Tony just sees them, Johnny included, as “Weapons.” All three capos break down crying at the revelation.
 In “The Many Saints of Springfield,” Johnny helped Fit-Fat Tony and the mafia assist Ned in his Left Hand Emporium business to pay off his debt. However, after Lisa Simpson revealed to Ned the truth, Johnny arrived to see what’s up in a threatening way, resulting Ned to send Lisa away to safety in pretend anger against Homer. Then later, Johnny, along with Legs and Louie, confront Homer on where Ned is since the latter escaped the mafia after confronting Fit-Fat Tony, only for Homer to escape when Louie accidentally cuts himself and subdued Johnny with his blood. Later, Johnny and Louie learn that Ned returned to Fit-Fat Tony and attempted to kill him, only for Ned to expose his hidden wire underneath his fake mustache, resulting Johnny and the mafia to get arrested.
 Laconic Johnny, at times, says very little, which spares him from accusations of being a ""Squealer,” (Being the only other suspect besides the more obvious Frankie the Squealer) but his reticence tends to be unhelpful to himself and/or others. When Homer and Krusty the Clown are caught by Fat Tony trying to steal several violin cases containing tommy guns (They were actually trying to take back a violin belonging to Krusty's daughter) during a mafia summit at his mansion, a shootout ensues and Johnny gets shot. When Louie asked him in concern where he is injured, he says, ""I ain't sayin' nothin'!"". When Louie asked in concern again on what he, himself, will tell the doctor, he says, ""Tell him to suck a lemon.""
 He has, however, elaborated sometimes. First example, he did explain to Homer, when Fat Tony explained to Homer that there was a way to settle his debt, (Via using his house as a movie set for an adult film) that the title is Lemony Lick-It's A Series of Horny Events.
 Even in ""Moe Baby Blues,"" when Louie was worried about killing his mother because she makes good pasta sauce, Johnny points out that it comes from a can, resulting Louie to rebuke his worries by saying, ""She's a corpse.""
 He also revealed to Louie that Fat Tony "" got a thing for the Ya-Yas."" when Louie complained to him in question about why they have to watch The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood on the mafia's private jet, easily indicating that Fat Tony likes that film and it moves him to tears literally. (""Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington"")
 He speaks occasionally in ""22 For 30,"" even revealing he has his grandmother, whom he affectionately calls ""Granny,"" when he sees his Black Lincoln Continental with a license plate number that reads ""ZERO2SAY"" being towed away from a no parking area with her inside it while he's at the La Coffee Nostra Cafe.
 He also admitted that his and the members of the mafia’s nicknames are so judgmental in “The Many Saints of Springfield.”
 Johnny was seen watching a beauty show on TV with Louie in ""Uncut Femmes"" while Fit-Fat Tony watched over Ralph while Homer and Wiggum were searching for Marge and Sarah Wiggum after their wives got kidnapped.
 In ""A Serious Flanders: Part One,"" he and the rest of Fit-Fat Tony's gang tried to threaten Kostas Becker to leave Springfield at Krusty Burger, but Kostas attacks them, killing him alongside the murdered Mr. Burns, Fit-Fat Tony, Legs, Louie, and Disco Stu.
 In The Simpsons: Tapped Out, Fat Tony puts Johnny in charge of Plato's Republic Casino. (In Johnny’s quest “Casinofellas”) He has to beat up Moe for allegedly paying minors to play online poker. Johnny gets caught by Wiggum. He later gets his cousin, Joey Cantmakeapizza, to be hired at Fat Tony’s pizza parlor. After the online casino gets closed, Fat Tony has Johnny in charge of moderating the casino’s page on SpringFace.
 Johnny is a reference to Frank ""Tight Lips"" Gusenberg, who was shot down in the real life St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago and repeatedly replied, ""Nobody shot me."", before dying at a local Chicago hospital.
 On the audio commentary for “Insane Clown Poppy,” it was discussed that the original name for him would be ""Tightlips Johnny.""

Portrayed by
Hank AzariaKarl Wiedergott



Professor John Frink, sometimes referred to as Doctor Frink or Dr. Jonathan Frink, Jr., is Springfield's local scientist and a professor at either Springfield Heights Institute of Technology or Springfield University, and is extremely brilliant, though somewhat socially inept. Frink often tries to use his bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises, but they usually only make things worse. He is a recurring character in The Simpsons and a supporting character in The Simpsons Movie, but he has a cameo appearance.
 Frink is Springfield's local mad scientist. He has a trademark mannerism of using gibberish when excited, such as ""GLAYVIN!"" and shouting other words that have no relevance to the situation at hand. He also occasionally refers to the importance of remembering to ""carry the one"" in various mathematical calculations. He is almost never seen without his glasses and has only taken them off once.
 Frink is said to have an IQ of 197 (199 before he sustained a concussion during the collapse of Springfield's brief intellectual junta). He is a member of the Springfield Mensa and a college professor at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology or Springfield University, and he consults at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He is fond of flubber, a material with enhanced bounce properties, of which his basketball shoes are made.
 Professor Frink is the inventor of, among other things, hamburger earmuffs, the flying motorcycle and the 8-month after pill. Some of Frink's inventions, such as the automatic phone dialer, work better than others, such as his radio-controlled plane, which carries babies as passengers under their parents' control, or a secure house that sprouts legs and runs away from potential danger (the legs of which often collapsed causing the house to crash to the ground and catch fire). Frink has also discovered and cured ""Frink's Disease"" and discovered ""Frinkonium.""
 In the 1960s, Professor Frink made napalm to drop on Da Nang. He once predicted that computers would be so large and so expensive that only the five richest kings of Europe would own them, a paraphrase of Thomas J. Watson's misquote. Professor Frink has more frequent contact with Lisa Simpson than the rest of the Simpson family because she is more interested in science and makes more frequent visits to places such as the Springfield Museum of Natural History and the Springfield Observatory.
 Frink has a wife (though they may be separated or divorced) and a young son who looks similar to him. When his son crashes through a window during a demonstration of a remote-controlled airplane, he says ""my wife is going to kill me"", but his son is seen alive later (Which means that either his son survived the airplane incident, or he has more than one son).
 Frink's father appears in the season 15 premiere Treehouse of Horror XIV. It is revealed that they do not have a good relationship, but since this episode is non-canon, it is unknown how well the younger Frink and his father actually get along. In the canon his parents were great chemists who paid attention to their work, so to get noticed Frink used science and changing the pitch of his voice so they couldn't help but notice him.
 In ""Future-Drama"", an episode set eight years into a possible future of Bart and Lisa's, a bespectacled skeleton dressed in a lab coat is observed hanging on a rope from a rafter in Frink's basement laboratory, indicating the professor has committed suicide in the interim (although this could be a clone or his aforementioned son), his death has gone unnoticed by family and friends.
 However, another episode set further in the future, ""Lisa's Wedding"", shows him alive and well as he leads a team trying to discover the cure for seventeen stab wounds in Mr. Burns's back, stating ""Well, we're up to fifteen!"".
 In the episode ""Days of Future Future"", Frink spends thirty years cloning Homer Simpson back to life until Homer uses up all the clones and is only able to store Homer's memory on the flash drive.
 In the final segment of ""Treehouse of Horror VI"", he explains that Homer is in the third dimension.
 In The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run, Frink appears in Level 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 with varying levels of importance to the game's plot.
 In The Simpsons Game, he lives inside the Game Engine and marries a Koopa Troopa from Super Mario Bros.
 In The Simpsons: Tapped Out you can have him from level 3, but it costs 150 donuts. It unlocks with Frink's Lab.
 In Simpsons Comic #19, Frink (while coaching Bart's baseball team) tells Lisa that in university his best friends were Ben Grimes, and Johnny and Sue Thunder. When Lisa asks what happened to them, he tells her they all died in an unrelated radiation poisoning mishap that is, of course, a reference to Marvel's Fantastic Four.
 Frink's icon in the Simpsons tapped out Professor Frink is voiced by Hank Azaria. The character was originally written as a mad scientist. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis' character from The Nutty Professor, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after writer John Frink; however, that was before he became a writer for the show. Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth. The nonsensical utterances that Frink makes are written in the scripts as ""Frink noise"".

Old Jewish Man,True,False,False,False,False,1,Castellaneta,81,"Mayor Joe Quimby once referred to him as ""Old Jewish Man""; in addition, a list of heart recipients listed him as ""Old Jewish Man"".
 In his youth he was an executive at Warner Bros during the making of Casablanca, having tacked on a later suppressed happy ending, with a question mark that left the door open for a sequel, and the It's a Wonderful Life ""killing spree ending"". He observes that the quality of studio management has changed over the years. At the time of the Casablanca blunder, they ""was just dopes in suits. Not like today!"" He diplomatically left unstated whether the difference is that studio executives are more intelligent now, or that they no longer wear suits. He once had a brief period of stardom after his act of dancing on a street corner singing ""The Old Gray Mare"" with his pants down became a hit on television.
 He is apparently friendly with Krusty the Clown and Krusty's father, as the three of them have been seen walking along a street singing the ditty ""Even though we're not gentile / We'll get together for a while"" at Christmas.
 He accidentally killed his uncle while trying to hold the ladder while he wound a clock.
 An most times, he is found in Springfield Retirement Castle, though he was once seen being delivered Meals on Wheels to a house which he apparently lives in.
 In ""Love is a Many Strangled Thing"", he dies by dancing too hard and his ghost escapes his body and dances. Despite his demise, he returns alive and well in the next episodes ""Replaceable You"" and ""To Cur, with Love"".
 He is an insectivore. Despite the Torah not allowing this.
 In ""The Winter of His Content"", he alongside his friends Abe Simpson and Jasper Beardly were taken by Marge Simpson to live in the Simpson House, after the retirement home lost its license and they didn't have any relatives to pick them up. There, they bonded with Homer and showed him the senior lifestyle.

Baby Gerald,True,False,False,False,False,5,Azaria,82,"Gerald Samson, better known as ""Baby Gerald"" or ""The Monobrow"" (or ""Unibrow Baby"") (born January 12), is Maggie's nemesis. He has a uni-brow (hence his nickname). He made his first appearance in ""Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"" (The 100th episode).
 Born on the same day as Maggie Simpson, the sub-par Springfield General Hospital had only one diaper left, and it was, of course, given to Maggie. Baby Gerald was wrapped in the discount section of the Springfield Shopper. Because of this, Gerald developed a terrible rash which still persists to this day. He blames Maggie for this uncomfortable condition and spends his nap times plotting revenge.
 Lisa has referred to Baby Gerald as Maggie’s rival. Gerald is distinguished by his uni-brow, being one of the few characters in the show to have one, along with Groundskeeper Willie (and along with most members of the Van Houten family, he and Willie are the few characters who have eyebrows at all).
 On a few occasions, Gerald has been shown being pushed in a stroller by his mother outside the Simpsons’ house, with the two babies glaring at each other, the camera focusing on their narrowed stares. Homer often mistakes Maggie for Baby Gerald.
 
Gerald apparently has a history of causing large scale public incidents and was once rescued from an unspecified disaster by Bart’s mail order “Wonder Dog” Laddie. Both dog and baby were participants in a ceremony presided over by Mayor Quimby, during which the mayor inquired, ""Baby Gerald, we can't help but wonder what mischief you'll get into next.""  Gerald is a baby who is the same age as Maggie. He has a wide black uni-brow (his main distinctive feature), a big wide nose, an overbite, two buck teeth (that are shown even when his mouth is closed), a blonde curly strand of hair on his forehead, and a couple of curly neck hairs (which look the same as his forehead hair). He usually wears a baby-blue onesie with a light blue bonnet.
 It is revealed that Maggie and Baby Gerald stopped being enemies and eventually got married. The marriage, however, was rocky and it is not clear if he is the father of Margaret ""Maggie"", Jr. 
 The two were seen together kissing as pre-teens at Milhouse's graduation party, and together at The Gilded Truffle, sharing a drink.
 In part 21 of ""the End of the Beginning"" story-arc in The Simpsons: Tapped Out, it's revealed upon rebooting R.O.S.A. that Gerald Samson was the reason why the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant underwent a meltdown seen in the opening for the game in the first place, as Gerald, in a tantrum due to being denied a donut due to being put in time out and thus not being ""tapped"", removed R.O.S.A.'s batteries and replaced them with Carbon Rods, causing R.O.S.A. to undergo a critical meltdown and forcing Maggie Simpson to shove R.O.S.A. into the nearby miniature nuclear reactor alongside herself in a failed effort to stop the meltdown (in a similar manner to the ending sequence for 2001: A Space Odyssey).

 Luigi Risotto (real name Lothar Folkman), is the proprietor of Luigi's. 
 A cooking prodigy, Lothar Folkman opened his Italian restaurant in Springfield to critical success, but empty seats. No one wanted to eat Italian food prepared by someone named Lothar. But after making a fake Italian accent, changing his name, and getting a makeover, his eatery became packed almost every night. Unfortunately, the charade has driven Luigi into a love/hate relationship with his customers that occasionally bubbles to the surface like tomato sauce in a pot that's one size too small.
 Luigi owns an Italian restaurant in Springfield, that serves average Italian food. Luigi often treats his customers rudely, insulting and belittling them (such as calling Bart “the ugly kid”); at times under his breath, at other times in a conversational tone, and sometimes shouting the slurs to the (unseen) chef Salvatore (”Hey, Salvatore! Give the ugly kid a plate of the red crap!”). Luigi seems to have some connections to the mafia. Local gangster Fat Tony is a frequent customer at his restaurant, despite the fact that he was one of the targets of Fat Tony's plan to get rid of all other food retailers except Marge's. He does not actually speak Italian, only ""fractured English"" with a strong Italian accent, as did his parents. He says the phrase, ""I guarantee,"" a lot.
 Luigi may be an illegal immigrant because he disappeared during an immigration officer's introduction at Luigi's restaurant and took the citizenship exam with Apu.
 When Homer was a food critic, he gave Luigi's eatery a poor review; in retaliation, Luigi hired a friend to place a horse's head in Homer's bed (a reference to The Godfather). Homer subsequently ate the head and gave it a bad review.
 
His one on-screen companion is Giuseppe the monkey. Finding Truffle? He can play the accordion.
 Luigi's real hair. In The Simpsons: Tapped Out (app for Android and iOS), Luigi has a slip of his tongue and reveals his true accent is British. He quickly realizes his mistake and returns to his Italian. He also reveals that his mother died from getting her mustache caught in a dough mixer.
 Luigi is a parody of the ""Italian pasta/pizza chef"" stereotype, but seems to be aware of his status as a stock character. His surname is a reference to the Italian food risotto. His name may also be a reference to inventor and musician Luigi Russolo. He also seems to be a parody of Tony from Lady and the Tramp and also sounds like Mario and Luigi of Super Mario Brothers.

 After Maude is accidentally killed by Homer, he mentions the waitresses they married in Las Vegas.
 Ginger and Amber later went to Springfield to stay with their husbands. Ginger left him because Ned, Rod, and Todd were too good (they flushed her cigarettes down the toilet and refused to provide her with Irish coffee).
 Ginger has fluffy, light brown hair. She wears a red-purple dress, a necklace, and gold triangular-shaped earrings. She wears heavy blue eye-shadow and pink lipstick. She also wears a gold ring with a blue jewel (possibly a sapphire) on it.
 She is not as promiscuous as Amber.

Amber Simpson,False,False,False,True,True,10,Hayden,86,"Amber Pai Gow Simpson was Homer's former ""Vegas wife"".
 Amber worked as a cocktail waitress in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is implied that she was also a prostitute.
 Homer and Flanders went to Las Vegas for the weekend. They got drunk and met Amber and Ginger when they were serving them their alcohol at a restaurant located in the Nero's Palace casino. In a drunken haze, they married the two women but abandoned them the next day, agreeing not to tell their families.
 After Maude's death, Homer mentions that Amber and Ginger were crazy about them. Marge asks what he is talking about, but Homer tells her that they're trying to help Ned deal with the death of Maude.
 Amber and Ginger later managed to track down Homer and Ned in Springfield. Homer attempted to annul his marriage to Amber, but it was upheld under Nevada law. To get rid of her, the Simpson family tricked Amber into marrying Grampa and agreeing to forsake her vows to Homer.
 Amber died of an overdose at a theme park in front of a sign warning guests not to stand up on a roller coaster. Her funeral was held in Springfield and attended by the Simpsons.
 Amber can be seen as a ghost inside Bart's dream.

Portrayed by
Julia Louis-Dreyfus


Gloria Jailbird (formerly Gloria Turley) is the wife of Snake Jailbird and the ex-fiancée of Mr. Burns. 
 After spending Flag Day at a wealthy social gathering and a strip club, Mr. Burns finds Gloria, who is a cop at that time, ticketing his car and asks her out on a date. She accepts, so Homer Simpson helps Mr. Burns in his dates, and later, Snake Jailbird attacks a bowling alley, and kidnaps Gloria (who is his ex-girlfriend) and Homer. Snake takes Gloria and Homer to his hideout. He ties Gloria up. Though Gloria says she loves Burns, Snake vows he can change. Homer tries to escape, but instead sets Snake's house on fire. Snake and Homer get out and Burns runs in to save Gloria (who can't get out because she is tied to a chair; Gloria then saves Burns). When she thinks of Snake, Gloria breaks up with Burns and becomes Snake's girlfriend again. Later, she is seen visiting Snake in prison. Gloria also makes an appearance with Snake asking if Homer's ""condos"" are in a school district, while her stomach looks bigger, suggested that she is pregnant with what is presumed as Snake's baby (while Snake questions why she should ""tell everybody""). She and Snake later get married.

Gil Gunderson,True,False,False,True,False,9,Castellaneta,88,"Gilbert ""Gil"" Gunderson (usually referred to as Ol' Gil) is an unsuccessful and unlucky businessman of Springfield.
 At the age of six, Gil was hired by his eight-year-old brother to run his sidewalk lemonade stand for the afternoon. By the end of the day, he had bankrupted his brother's business and drank all of the remaining inventory. Since then, Gil has not managed to hold down one job for longer than a few days. He kept his job at Red Blazer Realty for over twenty years by selling his own house to himself several thousand times. Eventually, the house was destroyed in the Great Springfield Flood of '99, and with no other sales prospects, he was fired.
 Gil has held many different jobs, usually involving sales, all of which he either eventually loses due to an inability to perform or make any sales or quits because something bad happens to him (for example, him being shot on his first day as a bank security guard). In almost every instance where it seems like he will succeed, it will almost certainly be ruined by the Simpsons.
 Gil frequently refers to himself in the third person (""C'mon, help Ol' Gil out here!""). Gil has been married, as evidenced by him mentioning that his wife was going to leave him if he didn't start ""bringing in the green"". Later, when he telephones his wife and overhears her carousing with his friend Fred, he doesn't have the heart to stop her, and in fact cheerfully greets Fred when he comes to the phone.
 He has several health problems, including bronchitis and a bad back. In ""Super Franchise Me"", it's revealed that he has scaly chicken-like legs due to an infection.
 Homer thinks he is a loser. Being very poor, he never misses a chance to mooch off the more fortunate. He even went as far as nearly doing anything he could to get Marge to get him to stay for eleven months, leading to her yelling and confronting him in the middle of one of his few successful jobs.
 Gil is commonly found in various jobs ranging from car salesman to real estate agent. He has encountered bad luck in all of these jobs.
 
Among the large number of jobs Gil has had is real estate agent. When Marge started working as a realtor, Lionel Hutz told her, ""Welcome to the big league, Marge. There's over fifty years of experience right in this room! And forty-two of those years are Gil's!"", which seemed to imply that before he ran into Marge, Gil actually kept professions. He used to be a salesman, but he didn't sell any cars. He was almost going to sell one to Homer, but another salesman took his sale.  Gil working as a car salesman  He has sometimes tried to be a lawyer, like when he assisted Marge with her anti-sugar campaign, one of his few successful jobs, though it was not the same when Homer and Marge went to prison. He once worked at the Kwik-E-Mart, but he slipped and hurt his leg. He also tried to persuade Bart to let him be his manager when he joined a jazz band in Jazzy and the Pussycats but was unsuccessful. He used to work at The Springfield Shopper, trying to sell newspaper subscriptions, but one of the customers on the phone told him to dance for it. Although that person couldn't see Gil, he danced anyway, desperate to sell something. He tried pitching a product for Amway - a multi-level marketing company - during an AA meeting after supposedly losing three jobs in two days. He was a ""Coleco"" computer salesman, asking the school to buy lots of computers to help ""Ol' Gil"". He also once had a job at Swapper Jack's, though it's unclear what specific role he had while he worked there.
 One of his most miserable jobs was one as a bank security guard, where he was shot several times by robbers just as he was entering the bank for his first day of work.
 Gil as a Mall Santa Gil got a job as a mall Santa, where he brought a Malibu Stacy out of the back-room stock for Lisa as a Christmas present, but it was for Mr. Costington's daughter, so he fired him. The Simpsons let him stay in their house for one night, but he brought all his stuff in and made it into an extended stay. He got on the entire family's nerves, but Marge found herself unable to kick him out because she could not say ""no"" to him. After an entire year, Gil finally moved to Scottsdale because he got a job as a real estate agent. Marge still had to say ""no"" to him, so the family went to Scottsdale to talk to him. There, they discovered Gil was actually successful at this job, as everyone acclaimed him. But when Marge finally confronted Gil and shouted at him because of his being so annoying, Gil's co-workers' thought was a miserable man, so he was fired. He stayed in a hotel with the Simpsons after that.
 Another of the few successful moments Gil has enjoyed is when he won a crossword contest, but only because he fooled Lisa by making her take his glasses, which he didn't actually need.
 Gil has had several homes. He once lived at the Springfield Men's Mission (a hostel for down-and-outs) but was forced out of the premises because he had overstayed the ""six-month occupancy limit."" A defiant Gil walked straight into a shady organ donation clinic to sell his eyes for cash. Gil used to live in a hot-air balloon, which was stolen by Homer and Marge. Gil's lone possession in the balloon is a hot plate (on which he still had two more payments to make). Gil has also been living in a storage locker  and in the sewers.
 Gil once attempted suicide by hanging himself with Christmas lights. He appears later ice skating near Homer's house with the Christmas lights around his neck.
 Gil nearly hit Snowball V in his car (just before Lisa adopted her), missing her and hitting a tree instead. Lisa saw the near-accident as a sign of good luck and decided to keep the cat, but Gil was left with a smashed-up and burning car. He still danced around celebrating, though, saying that thanks to insurance he would be eating that night. His car then explodes.
 He sues Homer for running over him, but the lawsuit settled in Homer's favor when he said he had to hit either him or a dog and the court officially and legally decided that the dog's life is more valuable and important than his.
 Like the other citizens of Springfield, he was fed up with the Simpsons and wanted them kicked out of town. When Homer and Marge snuck back into Springfield and was confronted by the townspeople, Gil suggested that they shoot them, which they were about to do until Homer and Marge decided to leave town on their own.
 He went to work for Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboards as a costumed mascot. As a mascot he worked several jobs including handing out flyers for a strip club and advertising for apartments. When Marge sees him changing, she sees he has dried legs with bird talons, and he says those are his real legs. In the episode he mentions that his father worked for one company for his whole career in the company basement mail room and ended his life by jumping out the window of the first floor. It is also revealed that he fell two credits short of graduation at Southern Illinois University.
 Another of his more successful moments was when he worked as an insurance agent for Springfield Conglomerate Insurance and the First Church of Springfield burned down. When he told Reverend Timothy Lovejoy that the church's insurance covers everything except the acts of God, Lovejoy responded that they believe everything is an act of God, to which he happily stamped ""REJECTED"" on the insurance policy, saving his company from a $1,500,023 liability payoff, before breaking into Saluki Strut with Homer and Bart.
 After Gil met Miss Hoover on an online social media group in support of Slow Leonard the tortoise, Gil formed a romantic relationship with her; he proposed to her, and they got married.
 Gil has also been seen as a farmer in Treehouse of Horror XIII. He had a thriving field of corn, which would have yielded a bumper crop; unfortunately, it was completely devoured by Homer's clones. The clones then ate Gil.
 In ""Days of Future Future"", he frequently goes to MovingOn.
 Homer Clones running at Gil In The Simpsons: Hit and Run, Gil appears in six of the seven levels (not the last level) and characters can purchase cars from him to ""help Ol' Gil out"".
 In The Simpsons Game, Gil can be seen walking around the Springfield main hub.
 Gil is based, in voice and appearance, on Jack Lemmon's portrayal of Shelley Levene in the film version of Glengarry Glen Ross: a nervous, middle-aged man with the inability to hold a steady job due to strings of misfortune that tend to hit him at the worst times.
 Ever since the death of Phil Hartman, he has occasionally replaced Lionel Hutz as The Simpsons' lawyer.

Cookie Kwan,False,False,False,False,True,9,MacNeille,89,"Cookie Kwan is a go-getter in the imploding Springfield real-estate industry, the self-proclaimed ""number one on the west side."" She is of Asian (possibly Chinese) heritage and has a stereotypical Asian accent, implying she's likely an immigrant. She works at Red Blazer Realty and considers herself a very eligible bachelorette.
 Cookie was introduced in the season 9 episode ""Realty Bites"" as a cut-throat realtor at Red Blazer Realty. She considered Springfield's ""west side"" to be her exclusive domain, and bullied all the other realtors, including Marge and Gil to ""stay off"" of her territory.
 She is friends with Lindsey Naegle, and the two are depicted as being quite man crazy. She once offered to have Homer move to her house. She once had a relationship with Mayor Quimby and they had a son, but Quimby gave him to one of his bodyguards. She was one of the 37 women filing paternity suits against Quimby.
 Cookie went to Camp Land-A-Man with Marge, Helen Lovejoy, Luann Van Houten, Patty and Selma when she was a child. Marge arranged a date with Homer, but he didn't appear, so Marge left. Cookie told everyone at the camp about it and that Marge was pregnant.
 She rented the apartment to Homer in Waverly Hills.
 She and her cousin Nookie Kwan (number one on the east side) once entered into a relationship with Professor Frink.

Itchy and Scratchy,,False,False,False,False,1,,91,"
The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show is an animated TV show (and a segment of The Krusty the Clown Show) on Channel 6. The show involves an anthropomorphic mouse named Itchy killing an anthropomorphic hapless cat named Scratchy. There is only one episode where Scratchy kills Itchy. The show contains extreme scenes of graphic violence, which is bloodier and more gruesome in a ""cute"" way, unlike Tom and Jerry and Spy VS Spy, which only contained mild slapstick violence (although the latter uses occasional gore under the penmanship of Peter Kuper). 
 Most of the time, each Itchy &amp; Scratchy episode is based on some kind of theme that the Simpsons episode is being aired as.
 For example, The Itchy &amp; Scratchy episode ""DiePod Slaylist"", shows Scratchy listening to a MyPod when Itchy turns the volume to extreme levels to make Scratchy's eye's explode, this is related with Lisa owning a MyPod.
 Chester Lampwick invented Itchy in the year 1919 and owns the rights to that character. Lampwick was also known as the ""father of cartoon violence."" Roger Meyers, Sr. (1899–1979) plagiarized Itchy and established Itchy and Scratchy Studios in 1921. Originally Itchy was called ""Itchy the Lucky Mouse"" (a parody of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit). He starred in his first cartoon made by Lampwick, ""Manhattan Madness"".
 Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928, entitled That Happy Cat. The film, which is about fourteen seconds of animation showing the cat walking and whistling, then stopping and tipping his hat, did very poorly. It is unknown who created Scratchy, but it likely he was plagiarized by Meyers Sr. in the same way that Itchy was.
 
Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together entitled ""Steamboat Itchy"", a parody of Disney's Steamboat Willie featuring Mickey Mouse. Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a wartime radio series, at least two films - Pinitchio and Scratchtasia, and television commercials for Laramie Cigarettes.
An X-rated Itchy &amp; Scratchy titled ""Itchy &amp; Scratchy meet Fritz The Cat"" was created during the 1970s. According to Comic Book Guy, only bootleg copies are available ""because of its frank depiction of sex and narcotic consumption"".
 At one point, additional characters were added to the pair on a show titled Itchy &amp; Scratchy and Friends Hour: Uncle Ant, Disgruntled Goat, Flatulent Fox, Ku Klux Klam, Manic Mailman, Dinner Dog and Rich Uncle Skeleton. These characters parodied the addition of superfluous, two-dimensional characters to TV shows in an effort to draw viewer interest.
 Itchy and Scratchy Studios was run by Roger Meyers, Jr. (born 26 January, 1936), the son of the cartoon's ""creator."" Itchy and Scratchy Studios was bankrupted after being sued by Lampwick for $800 billion, but was saved after receiving a large cash settlement from the government over its use of Mr. ZIP.
 The Itchy and Scratchy Show aired as a segment on The Krusty the Clown Show, though it moved to the Gabbo show during the latter's short-lived run. The show underwent a non-violent retooling following a protest campaign led by Marge Simpson, but after Marge was later discredited, it returned to its original violent format. The show has spawned an Academy Award-winning film adaptation, amusement parks, and a musical.
 The show was animated in South Korea. June Bellamy (a takeoff on the late voice actress June Foray) voices both Itchy and Scratchy.
 In 1995, the company renamed the studio to Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Studios via their Krustylu studio lot.
 In the episode ""Bart vs. Itchy &amp; Scratchy"", the show was briefly changed to an all girl show to pander to the girl viewers. This of course was rivaled with hate from the former male audience it had and started an all out gender war between the BRA and the BR, each trying to destroy each others episodes.
 Poochie, a short lived character on the show. Poochie was a dog character added to the Itchy &amp; Scratchy lineup. According to the show's plot, the producers believed the cartoons were getting stale, and needed a new character to reinvigorate the show, despite the objections of one of the show's writers, who ""at the risk of sounding pretentious"", felt that Itchy and Scratchy comprised ""a dramaturgical dyad"". Homer Simpson gets the job of voicing Poochie, who is introduced in the Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoon, The Beagle Has Landed. A product of marketing department thinking, Poochie was near-universally despised, and was killed off in his second appearance, to the joy of Bart, Lisa and every other person in Springfield, despite Homer's objections. In spite of this, Poochie has made a few appearances in future episodes, being possibly ""revived"" and also changing everyone else's minds. 
 The opening theme is short and simple, and is sung by high-pitched chipmunk-like voices. The lyrics:
 ""They fight! And bite!
They fight and bite and fight!
Fight, fight, fight!
Bite, bite, bite!
The Itchy and Scratchy Show!""
 The closing theme is much the same, only at a soft tempo and lyrics in the past tense, being sung by a female chorus and accompanied by a soft piano:
 ""They fought! And bit!
They fought and fought and bit!
Fought, fought, fought!
Bit, bit, bit!
It was The Itchy and Scratchy Show!""
 In Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge, the theme song is changed after Marge complaining about the cartoon being too violent. It is in a similar format to the closing theme, but at a faster tempo. The Lyrics:
 ""They love! and share!
 They share and love and share!
 Love, Love, Love!
 Share, share, share!
 The Itchy and Scratchy Show!""
 In The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show, the theme song is mostly the same with the addition of Poochie.
 ""They fight and bite!
 And bark!
 They fight and bite and fight!
 And bark!
 Fight, bite, bark!
 Woof, woof, woof!
 The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show!""
 In ""Yellow Subterfuge"" The Jamacian version of Itchy and scratchy (itchem and scratchem blow) has a theme song where itchy and scratchy are rastafarians.
 They Smoke and toke
 They smoke and toke and smoke
 Smoke Smoke Smoke
 Toke Toke Toke
 The Itchem and scratchem Blow!
 In some episodes, if either the television is turned on with one 1 of the main characters or everybody switches the channel, the lyrics are shortened to:
 ""The Itchy and Scratchy Show!""

 In the ""Treehouse of Horror IX"" segment The Terror of Tiny Toon, Bart and Lisa entered their television and were attacked by Itchy &amp; Scratchy. At the end of the story, they broke out of the TV into the real world: Fortunately they were not a threat, as they were the same size as ""real-world"" cats and mice. When Scratchy fell in love with Snowball II, much to his dismay, Marge decides to get him neutered to prevent from reproducing And Itchy is put in a hamster cage
 In the future, the show is viewable by a hologram, a 40 year old Bart Simpson watches it and board with it.
 A video game named The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Game was released for Sega Megadrive/Genesis, Game Gear, Super NES and Game Boy. Another game, Itchy and Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness, was released for Game Boy. A level of the SNES/Genesis game Bart's Nightmare also prominently features Itchy and Scratchy. There was a special unlockable level in the The Simpsons Wrestling where only Itchy and Scratchy are playable.
 The characters of Itchy and Scratchy also appear in The Simpsons Game, featured in the level Grand Theft Scratchy in the form of pimps and hoodlums.
 The duo have also appeared in the pre-show video for The Simpsons Ride where they host a video called ""Safety First"" in which they demonstrate the safety rules that riders must follow before boarding the ride vehicles.
 The Itchy and Scratchy Show is a parody of ""Tom and Jerry"" which first broadcasted in 1940, and ""Herman and Katnip"" which broadcasted in 1950.
 The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show first appeared in Tracey Ullman Show short ""The Bart Simpson Show"", which originally aired November 20, 1988. At this point in the show, both characters were sized to the scale of a real cat and mouse, both characters were feuding and the violence was fairly typical; later on both characters became more anthropomorphic, the conflicts were established to be only Itchy's end with Scratchy only ever retaliating in self defense, and the violence being extremely graphic.
 They are based on Tom and Jerry and other cat &amp; mouse cartoons. As a child, series creator Matt Groening and his friends would fantasize about an ultra violent cartoon and how much fun it would be to work on a show like that. The names ""Itchy"" and ""Scratchy"" were inspired by ""Pixie and Dixie"", who were mice on the cartoon show Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks. The comics Kit ‘n’ Kaboodle and Squeak the Mouse are the only ones to be considered as an apparent inspiration for these characters. David Silverman, a director and producer for The Simpsons, states that the show is based on Herman and Katnip.
 ""Itchy and Scratchy"" cartoons are often added when a show needs expanding or when there is an issue that the writers wish to satirize. The shorts are often hard for the writers and take a long time to develop and come up with a title for the short and in the end they do not fill up a large amount of time. Writing the Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoons is quite often a group effort, with it being pitched out one gag after another. Itchy &amp; Scratchy are a favorite of John Swartzwelder, who has written many of the episodes that center around them and quite often pitches the ideas for the shorts.
 In several episodes centering around the production of The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show, such as ""The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"", the show's staff are shown. Almost all of them are caricatures of the actual staff of The Simpsons. In the first scene at the production table the person in the lower right corner, wearing a squid T-shirt, is David X. Cohen. On the left side, the furthest away is Bill Oakley with Josh Weinstein next to him. Next to Weinstein is George Meyer, who is the writer who speaks out and gets fired. The animator shown designing Poochie is supervising director David Silverman. Others who appear include Dan McGrath, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Donick Cary, Ron Hauge, Ned Goldreyer and Mike Scully, who had to be added in later, as the animators ""didn't have his photo"" from which to get an accurate likeness.
 Itchy is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and Scratchy is voiced by Harry Shearer.
 In a 2006 article IGN.com ranked Itchy &amp; Scratchy in tenth position on their list of the ""Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters"", citing that ""the Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show shines a nice mirror on cartoons, showing just how funny cartoon violence really is."" In 2007, Vanity Fair named ""The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"" the sixth best episode in the show's history, describing it as ""a classic satire of network influence, obsessed TV fans, and programs that survive long after the shark has been jumped, the episode is a meta-celebration, a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to everyone who claimed that the quality of The Simpsons had declined over the years."" Todd Gilchrist called it a masterpiece, stating it ""could easily be packaged and sold by itself."" Comic Book Guy's phrase ""Worst. Episode. Ever"" was named as a quote that could be used in everyday life, as well as being one of the most popular quotes from the show, by The A.V. Club.

Abe Simpson II,True,False,False,False,True,1,Castellaneta,92,"Effie Lou Abraham Jebediah ""Abe"" Simpson II, commonly known as Grampa Simpson or simply Grampa, is a major recurring character in The Simpsons and a supporting character in The Simpsons Movie. He is the oldest patriarch of the Simpson family, husband of Rita LaFleur, ex-husband of the late Mona Simpson, father of Homer Simpson, Herbert Powell, and Abbey, father-in-law of Marge Simpson and paternal grandfather of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson. He is also the ex-boyfriend of Jacqueline Bouvier.
 Abe was a World War II veteran who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He is known for his long, rambling, and often inaccurate stories.
 Abe Simpson and his father. Abraham Simpson II was born and raised in June 4th 1900 in the ""Old Country"" to his father, Orville Simpson and his mother, Yuma Hickman, before immigrating as a young child to the United States and briefly living inside the Statue of Liberty. His great-great-grandmother Mabel Simpson helped a slave (his great-great-grandfather, Virgil Simpson, to be exact) escape to Canada.
 In the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Abe was participating in the javelin event. His throw narrowly missed Hitler, who was watching in the stands. Unfortunately, it missed and hit the man who was about to assassinate him. At a later date, Grampa claimed that he and Hitler laughed about it.
 By the time he retired, Abe served in every branch of the United States Armed Forces, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, from which he claimed to have resigned on the day the Spanish Civil War broke out.
 Abe leading the Flying Hellfish After the United States declared war, he supposedly tried to avoid service by dressing in drag and playing for a women's baseball team in 1942, which kept him from serving for a year before he was eventually discovered during a game. Abe got separated from his platoon after he parachuted into Dusseldorf. He disguised himself as a cabaret singer, making sexual motions towards Hitler, but when he leaned in down, one of the fruits in his bra fell onto the stage and Hitler was disgusted.
 He also served on a destroyer called the USS World War One during World War II. The USS World War One was sunk by a heat seeking torpedo that they fired the previous day. After the ship was sunk, Abe and his fellow sailors rode on the back of sharks to avoid being eaten by them and had them swim in formation to spell a rescue message.
 In 1944, Abraham fathered an illegitimate daughter named Abbey in England on the day before he joined the D-Day operations in Normandy. He hided England in 1945. Then D-Day by covertly hiding on the back of a landing ship as it returned to England While he claimed to the soldiers that he would see them in 1946, one account showed he and his unit (the Flying Hellfish) were involved in the Battle of the Bulge, narrowly avoided assassinating Hitler, and flushed out an abandoned castle occupied by Nazis and stole works of art, forming a tontine with the other members.
 He once showed Bart and Lisa an album with photos of Germans killed by his platoon. He was also awarded the Iron Cross for accidentally directing U.S. jeeps into Nazi minefields.
 Abraham also says that he served on PT Boat 109 where he heard John F. Kennedy speaking in German (""Ich bin ein Berliner""). Abe claims that he is a Nazi and he and the fellow sailors tackle Kennedy.
 He boasts of having been a watchman at Pearl Harbor (falling asleep on duty), and claims that President Grover Cleveland spanked him on two nonconsecutive occasions.
 In 1947, he met future Itchy creator and bum Chester Lampwick, and he offered him a plate of corn muffins under the condition that Lampwick paint his chicken coop. However, he never did, resulting in Abe carrying a grudge against him. Lampwick later revealed that this was because the corn muffins were ""lousy"".
 During the 1950s, Abraham was a professional wrestler known as Glamorous Godfrey.
 Abe and Mona's wedding in the 1950s. Abe had a sexual relationship with a woman named Edwina, which resulted in the pregnancy with his illegitimate daughter Abbey before he was shipped out during World War II. Several years after the war, he went to the carnival, and encountered a prostitute named Gaby, thus resulting in the he procreation of his illegitimate son, Herb Powell.
 He then married Mona Simpson, and after having a bit of his tonic with her, they made love and created Homer. Shortly after Homer's birth, Mona also made Abe swear not to tell Homer that he has a half brother. He continued to use the Simpson Farm until the bank foreclosed the farm in 1963, due to the cows producing sour milk, theorizing that something must have spooked them good (unknown to Abe, the reason why the cows were spooked was because Homer had traumatized them by running around and yelling at them). When Homer aspired to become President of the United States (more specifically President Kennedy), Abe had beat Homer down for thinking that he even had a chance of becoming President. After moving from the farm, they settled in an apartment and watched the third Super Bowl, which indirectly made him responsible for his wife becoming a hippie. He was then dragged to Woodstock, and after scolding Homer for emulating the Hippie lifestyle, attempted to send him off to the Vietnam War. After Mona was forced to run away from home after destroying Mr. Burns' Germ Warfare Lab, he lied to Homer by claiming that Mona died when he was at the movies.
 It was Abe's mediocre fathering that caused Homer to turn out the way he is today. It was even stated that if he had been a better father, Homer would have been a better one too.
 Abe was once arguing with Mona which she stormed out, which caused him to be a single father, suffering to pay the bills, and then resorting to alcoholism and completely ignoring Homer. Abe was a terrible father to Homer, but they both have shared their own moments of father/son relationship.
 Homer was employed at Abe's laser-tag business while trying to pay for Marge's tuition fees. Homer presumably quit after he'd found fame with his Grunge band Sadgasm. In the music video for Sadgasm's song ""Margerine"", Abe is seen wearing a diaper.
 Article about Abe, shouting at cloud During the family's visit to Wet 'N' Wacky World, when the rest of the family watches Slimu, Grampa stays on a shark bench and recalls how he once rode a shark. Then, newspaper columnist Marshall Goldman turns up, and is interested in his stories. Soon, the entire popularity of Springfield is reading them. Despite being offered a chance for Mitch Albom to write about him, Grampa sticks with Marshall, who is constantly with him writing what he says. Homer comes to visit his father, but Abe rejects him. While Homer is submitting a column to the shopper about Mr. Burns (who Homer uses as an adoptive father to get back at Abe), he sneaks into Marshall's office, and finds out that Marshall is planning to kill Abe at precisely 3pm on the Tinseltown Starliner, and even has the article and award application ready.
 Meanwhile, at the Springfield Union Station, Abe is aboard the train with Marshall, and despite Homer's many attempts to warn him, Abe has no idea what is happening due to his hearing problems. Later, when Abe is sleeping, Marshall is just about to suffocate him when Homer jumps aboard and stops him, not expecting Marshall to pull out a knife, and then retrieve a gun form the pillow. They both wrestle for control of the gun when Abe gets up and hits Marshall on the head with a bottle, but had no effect. When putting his hands up to surrender, he grabs the train's emergency brake lever, which sends Marshall flying back and causes him to be crushed by luggage. Both Homer and Grampa then embrace, and the family is back together. In the end, Abe decides to let Homer tell the story of how he saved Homer's life (his first ramble) and Homer ends up talking about Godzilla and the Rolling Stones. In one episode, Abe won the senior Olympics.
 Jasper and Abe after unintentionally consuming peyote Due to his apparent senility, Abe is often ignored by Homer and other cast members, and is alternatively content with this, resentful of this, or completely unaware of his being ignored. Abe is very friendly with Jasper and the Old Jewish Man, like Hans Moleman. Abe often appears in recurring gags as well, such as the couch gags. He is also very unlucky and forgetful at times sometimes forgetting where he lives or where his son lives.
 Abe had many affairs with lots of women, such as Beatrice Simmons in ""Old Money"", where she died by fainting and left Abe an inheritance of $106,000. He had also married Selma in ""Rome-Old and Julie-Eh"". Abe has also had many relatives who he has mentioned in his stories several times. Abe has also acted as a good father to Homer at times and has also acted as a good grandfather to Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. However, he does not like cheekiness from Homer, Bart or Lisa; he also demands to be treated right and he reckons that he is just as important as the others. He also had dated Jacqueline Bouvier, Marge's mother, in ""Lady Bouvier's Lover"".
 For forty-five years, Abe was a security guard. Within his elderly years, he was a Sprawl-Mart greeter in Eddystone Pa, a cartoon writer, and a traveling salesman of an aphrodisiac.
 Abe was not a particularly caring father to Homer, as evidenced at one point when he tells his son, ""Homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly. If a strange man offers you a ride, I say take it!"" Homer does not normally appear to resent these casual abuses, though in ""Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy"", in which Abe calls Homer an accident, years of pent up anger on Homer's part leads to a temporary estrangement. Due to the rough childhood he has endured under Abe, Homer takes every opportunity to ignore or eject his father, whom he placed in a dilapidated retirement home.
 Abe as a greeter Abe held a variety of postwar jobs, including a farmer during Homer's early childhood until the bank foreclosed. Abe's exact job after he lost the farm, and later on, his wife, differed depending on the account. He told the writers of The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show that he was a night watchman at cranberry silo for forty years. However, in other flashbacks when Mona was still living with them, Abe appeared as a worker at a smokestack factory, and later on, after Mona left him, he was a busboy at the restaurant Spiro's, where he met Rita LaFleur.
 He spent most of this time living in a house that he won on a crooked 1950s game show until he sold it to help Homer buy a house for his family. Abe moved in with the family, but was sent to a retirement home three weeks later. Abe was also angered about Homer's role in ensuring of the Trappuccino incident, yelling, ""I'm part of the mob!"" when Homer inquired on his safety.
 However, Abe was shown to have genuine care for Homer, as seen when Homer was a boy. Homer was hospitalized after an accident at Abe's wedding (where he married Rita LaFleur) and decide to remain with Homer, whom he believed would be killed by 220 volt outlets, rather than leave for Europe with Rita.
 Abraham Simpson is the estranged husband of Mona Simpson, father of Homer Simpson, father-in-law of Marge Simpson and paternal grandfather of siblings Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. He also fathered two illegitimate children; a daughter named Abbey by a British lady named Edwina while in England during World War II, and Herbert Powell with a carnival hooker named Gaby. He was briefly married to Amber, the same woman Homer married on a Vegas binge. Also in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album, the family tree shows his parents' names to be Orville Simpson and Yuma Hickman. Abe's brother Cyrus appeared in ""Simpsons Christmas Stories"", where it shows that Cyrus lives in Tahiti with multiple wives. In ""Million-Dollar Abie"", Abe mentions that he has a brother named Bill.
 A family tree showing Abe's known family members can be seen here.
 Out of his grandkids, he is closest with Bart, showing an affection for him he rarely shows for anyone else and essentially acting as his father figure due to Homer's inability to properly do so because of his favoritism of Lisa and Maggie and his frequent abuse of Bart, along with his general lack of intelligence and parenting skills. Examples of this when he gave Bart a bike for his 12th birthday and letting him hide from the cops with him after he ran away due to feeling neglected because of Lisa, and when he goes on a journey with him for the German painting tontine, telling him stories and saying that Bart reminds him of himself and could have become sergeant of his squad. Abe's connection with Bart might also tie into how he must've realzied how he messed up alot as a father with Homer by not being supportive of him and being emotionally abusive. So he sees connecting with Bart as almost a second chance to make up for not being a good father figure. Bart (for the most part) returns this feeling, such as when he refuses to break the streetlight outside of his retirement home, and when he's 15 and goes to his grave for comfort when he's upset about homer and says he misses him and wishes he was there, even going as far as to kiss his tombstone in an unheard of show of affection from Bart. Despite this, he can be irritated by Bart's troubles and can even strangle Bart to punish him if Bart crosses the line.
 Mona and Abe He was married for several years to Mona, who became entranced with the hippie lifestyle after watching Joe Namath on TV. She became a fugitive from justice after she abetted in the sabotage of a biological weapons research lab on germs, owned by Charles Montgomery Burns. Abe had no interest in this, instead focusing on the TV. Mona was forced to leave to give the two a better life. Abe tells 9-year-old Homer that Mona died while he was at the movies. Abe and Mona also don't seem to get along with each other, as seen in several episodes where they are usually arguing among themselves.
 The dialysis center Abe lives in Grampa Simpson is old, grizzled, periodically incontinent and quite senile to the extent of calling someone a fish tank. He lives in the Springfield Retirement Castle, which is a sad, lonely place filled with demented, crippled and depressed old people (a sign near the entrance says ""Thank you for not discussing the outside world""). Abe also informs Lisa that residents are not allowed to read newspapers because ""they angry up the blood"". His closest friend appears to be Jasper Beardsley, a fellow Retirement Castle resident.
 He is also shown to be something of a crackpot, as evident by the following letter from ""Bart the General"":
 Abe typing an angry rant about the media's portrayal of old people. He spends a good deal of his time writing letters of complaints. He once wrote to the President, complaining that there were too many states, and requesting that they get rid of three of them (simultaneously insisting that he was ""not a crackpot""). He also wrote to ""the sickos at Modern Bride Magazine"" about his disgust at not seeing ""one wrinkled face"" or ""a single toothless grin"" in the publication. He also owns a 49-star American flag because of an undefined hatred of Missouri. Abe has many traits of stereotypical old men. These traits include back pain, the inability to hear, falling asleep suddenly, among other traits.
 He also is soundly rooted in his antiquated ways: ""The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead and that's the way I likes it!"" Like many of his fellow retirement home residents, Abe is a devoted follower of Matlock. He even supports tearing down the Simpson household to complete construction of the proposed ""Matlock Expressway"". He seems to believe Matlock is a real person, suggesting they call him in to solve real-life crimes: ""I say we call Matlock. He'll find the culprit. It's probably that evil Gavin MacLeod or George Lindsey."" During a Matlock public appearance, Abe and Jasper swiped Matlock's pills which were needed to prevent him from having a spastic heart failure. Once when reflecting on his life, he lamented it as terribly boring and full of unruly teenagers, but then decided it was alright because he ""did have two shows with Andy Griffith.""
 He also had a habit of telling long stories about his past, though a lot of the time they didn't really happen. Presumably his senility caused him to think he really did have these experiences; alternatively he could have simply been lying about them. However, at least a few of his stories were true to an extent: namely the ones about the Flying Hellfish and Simpson Gene.
 In flashbacks he was strict and commanding as a result of his military background and somewhat condescending towards his son Homer which resulted in him having self-esteem issues and other insecurities. However, he displayed knowledge of social pressure when he described his experiences of trying to be ""with it"" to Homer and Barney Gumble. He also seemed to have had a difficult relationship with his first ex-wife and Homer's mother Mona due to their opposing sociopolitical and parenting views, since Homer had long believed his mother dead and Abe was always an open detractor of people like hippies.
 Abe once served in the navy with his brother Cyrus and Mr. Burns. Abe once got stranded on a deserted island with Burns after a plane he was piloting crash landed after being shot down by Japanese planes. During his time stranded on the island, Mr. Burns accidentally shot down Santa Claus thinking he was Japanese, so Burns and Abe helped Santa fix his sled and he left, saying that he would return to take him home. However, it never happened, and Abe held a grudge against Santa until he apologized to Abe.
 He first appears in the level Mob Rules as one of the Springfieldians that Marge can bring into her mob to protest the sale of the Grand Theft Scratchy video game to minors. His younger self appears in Medal of Homer to give Bart and Homer orders as for what to do in each of the two missions.
 He is one of the five characters that the player has at the start of the game. His car is The Shriner.
 In one possible future, 30 years from the present, Homer keeps Abe in Springfield Cryogenic Facility due to it being much cheaper than a nursing home. He is present at Homer's last clone's funeral around the same time.
 In one possible future, two years from the present, when Bart hides at the Retirement Castle after breaking street lights, Grampa gives him a BMX bike. Grampa dies between two and five years from the present.
 In ""Mr. Lisa's Opus"", at age 97 he is seen at the hospital in poor health.
 During the crossover, Abe runs over Peter Griffin.
 Abe is shown to be a resident of The Webs at Giant Spider Acres.
 Matt Groening famously named the five main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Marge (or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa, and Margaret (Maggie). Claiming that it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself, he chose the name ""Bart"", an anagram of brat. When it came time to give Grampa Simpson a first name, Groening says that he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, the writers chose the name Abraham, unaware that it was also the name of Groening's grandfather.

Judge Constance Harm,True,False,False,True,False,13,stars,93,"Judge Constance Harm J.D. is a sadistic and unforgiving disciplinarian. She enjoys creating cruel and unusual punishments for defendants in her court, whether or not they’re even criminals. Usually Judge Snyder resolves court cases, but Judge Harm has mainly been used for handing down negative verdicts, such as sentencing a family member to serve a prison term.
 Judge Constance Harm's houseboat at 1 Ocean View Drive Harm is notorious for having a tougher than nails approach in how she runs her courtroom, and takes a dim view of people making personal remarks about her. For example, when Bart appealed a restraining order that Lisa had on him, he implied that Judge Harm had no sense of humor, and that was why she became a judge instead of finding a husband. Judge Harm indignantly retorted, ""I have a husband!"", and extended the restraining order on Bart from 20 feet to 200 feet, after he asked whether this spouse in question was “blind and deaf”.
 Judge Harm was first seen when she filled in for Judge Snyder, who had just gone on vacation. She immediately established a complete contrast to Snyder's generally easy-going style: Judge Snyder kept a figurine of a fishing clown on his bench for an ornament, but Harm had a guillotine. Despite being presented as a supposed fill-in for Springfield regular Judge Snyder, Judge Harm would become a regular recurring character after her debut appearance in ""The Parent Rap"".
 In spite of her often-harsh attitude, Judge Harm is a competent jurist and fluent in the law (though has placed sentences on people that a judge would never place on someone in real life, such as place a pair of people in wooden stocks to be hit by anyone, or increase the distance of a restraining order so much that the person must live outside).  She at times has shown favoritism towards Bart, such as when she blamed Homer for Bart's bad behavior and also when she was quick to emancipate him from the birth-given guardianship and parental custody of Homer and Marge long before he could reach legal adulthood at the age of 18. When Homer tried to declare bankruptcy and cited legal definitions to prove his point, Harm didn't buy it. She pointed out that he was referring to the old bankruptcy laws and thus still was required to pay his creditors. She then ordered him to get financial counseling. In addition, she also implied that she allowed Bart to be emancipated from Homer Simpson solely because even she was disgusted with Homer's actions to his son.
 Harm is male-to-female transgender. On another occasion when Bart appeared in her courtroom to defend his parents, she said to him, ""You remind me of me, when I was a little boy."" The revelation came as a shock to Snake: ""Did she say she used to be a dude?"" She reveals while she appreciated his honesty, Harm still had to lay down the law.
 Harm also revoked Homer's driver's license after he drove his car off the dock (due to having so many accessories installed in his car that he wasn't paying attention to his driving). After Homer was rescued by the Coast Guard, he appeared in Harm's courtroom, where upon viewing the video evidence to what had transpired, she cut up Homer's license, guillotined the pieces, fed the remaining shards to a pair of dogs, and then ordered the court officers to ""Burn their poop!""
 When Marge tried to remove a restraining order Lisa put on Bart, Bart ""defends himself"" by saying that his sister had no sense of humor and stated ""that's why you became a judge instead of finding a husband."" Harm fired back, stating that she had a husband named Dwayne, in which Bart becomes shocked, and in his usual unaware of how what he says might come off agenda, says, ""what is he, blind and deaf?"" in which Harm then sets the restraining order from 20 feet to 200 feet (61 meters).
 In ""The Parent Rap"", Harm appears single, childless and lives only with her pet seal Poncho. However, she did later claim to have a husband in ""On a Clear Day I Can't See My Sister"" and has had some relationships from time to time. She at one point dated Moe, as revealed in The Book of Moe.

Herman Hermann,True,False,False,False,False,1,Shearer,94,"Herman Hermann, voiced by Harry Shearer, is the owner of Herman's Military Antiques. He dresses in military fatigues.
 Herman's not a very important and known person in Springfield, but he'll often participate in large mobs and crowds. He is shown to be an instigator, mainly because conflict at the roots of his military shop. Apparently, Herman bought one of Homer’s DJ pizza robots, which he later sold to a JJ Abrams film crew.
 In ""Homer Goes to Prep School"", he appears as a member of the Preppers (People who believe society will end at any moment). He's also an insectivorian.
 Herman formerly had two arms. He told Bart that the other arm was lost by sticking it out of the window of a moving bus (hailing) and it was torn off by a truck driving in the other direction. It was also implied it was him, as Ms. Krabappel said not to do it because a kid once lost an arm that way, while on a bus. However, in To Cur, with Love, it was revealed that he stuck it out on a street while trying to hail a car, resulting in the arm being torn off by a passing dogcatcher truck driven by Chief Wiggum. It is similar to Hawaiian surfer Bethany Hamilton, who lost her arm in a shark attack while surfing by the beach, which occurred around the time the episode ""Treehouse of Horror XIV"" aired.
 He's a skilled military tactician, though his sanity's somewhat questionable (Bart considered him ""a little nuts"", while Abraham Simpson actually said he was ""out of his mind""). Herman was instrumental in Bart’s victory in water balloon combat against Nelson, and the negotiation of the peace treaty between the two combatants.
 He's friends with Abraham Simpson, to whom he sold a hat, claiming it was previously owned by Napoleon. He also claimed that he owned ""the hat McKinley was shot in"". He also has a mysterious friend called Zed, who presumably is the same Zed as in the movie Pulp Fiction; a homosexual rapist. Herman was a member of The Stonecutters, and possibly the ""No Homers"" club. He was also a poker buddy of Homer Simpson. 
 Herman in the Simpsons' garage selling counterfeit jeans. He once sold counterfeit jeans out of the Simpsons' garage, and held Homer hostage when he stumbled upon his job. He was foiled by Marge Simpson, though he wasn't put in jail because the evidence was stolen by the Springfield PD.
 He once captured Chief Wiggum and Snake Jailbird and held them hostage. He also attempted to hold Kirk Van Houten hostage to silence him, but was thwarted (accidentally) by the latter's son Milhouse, wielding a flail.
 Harry Shearer does an impression of George H. W. Bush for Herman's voice. Herman's facial design is modeled after the show's most prolific writer John Swartzwelder, who created the character. The writers had originally planned for Herman to give a new explanation for how he lost his arm every time he appeared.

Nelson Muntz,True,True,False,False,True,1,Hayden,95,"GoliathWilbur MuddSmelsonNelly No-Sleeves Nelson Mandela Muntz Sr (born October 30, 1979) is a major character and recurring antagonist of The Simpsons and a child citizen of Springfield. He is the one of the school bullies and a fourth grader at Springfield Elementary School. Nelson hits Bart for having damaged Adolf Hitler's car. Nelson was first shown as a bully and the arch-rival of Bart who took him to a fight. Over the years, he has terrorized most male kids in Springfield and was even seen bullying teenagers (also known as Jimbo Jones and the Squeaky-voiced Teen). Nelson has a manner of showing up in awkward situations of surprise or misfortune and regularly pinpoint it by laughing at the concerned people (""Ha-ha!"" became his catchphrase). When cornered about the awkwardness of those situations, Nelson usually gives a very reasoned explanation as to why he acted the way he did, sometimes even pseudo-scientifically proving it (""See, epidermis means your hair, so technically it's true. That's what makes it so funny."")
 Nelson's earliest appearance.  Nelson currently studies in the fourth grade but was already a student when Bart Simpson came to school. As he said on one occasion, ""I've been held back more times than I can count. Which I guess is why I keep getting held back."" As such, he mainly remains skeptical of Edna Krabappel's remarks and laughs at nerds present in his class as he well knows all the correct answers to the teacher's every question.
 However, on another occasion, timber sports commentator Chip Bunyan said Nelson is ten years old. Herman also said that the saturation bombing campaign against Nelson (with water balloons) ""can't fail against a ten-year-old"".
 Young Nelson Nelson represented Japan at the Model UN club  and serves as a quarterback for the Pee-Wee school's football team (on one occasion he even catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease), which he almost single-handedly carried over the rivals at some point. He has a surprising facility for planning, as he tells Marge when she says she wants to take down Mixed Fighting that she will need parents, sympathetic school officials and clergymen, a place to meet, snacks, staplers, and a phone-tree; (which he considers to be invaluable in regards to organizing a protest) to even have a chance at taking down an entire sport. He turns out to be a fan of many unexpected things, such as Andy Williams and Snow White. He is also an expert in the proper preparation of Huckleberries and eats tadpoles for brunch and lunch. Another time he was apparently a master of disguise, fooling even Bart and Ned Flanders. Finally, he was also depicted as having master answer sheets to various tests and assignments at school. He has an ""office"" located in a toilet stall where he has the answer sheets hidden in the toilet cistern.  Nelson in an entrepreneur suit  In the episode ""Loan-a Lisa"", he starts his own business using the fifty dollars Lisa donated to him. In a video link, Nelson says that he used some of the money to treat his mother the way she deserves. In the same episode, he is very caring towards Lisa at the end as he makes up an excuse to hold her hand as they are rollerblading.
 Nelson's choice of social ethics seems to sprout from edgy reasons and rules understood only to himself: when Bart (truthfully) claimed to have been Krusty the Clown's assistant, Nelson beats Bart up in the stomach, saying: ""That's for taking credit for other people's work!"". Nelson also beats Bart up after the latter accidentally wrecked Adolf Hitler's vehicle at a carnival. (""You wrecked Hitler's car! What did he ever do to you?"") Bart also got beaten by bullies for tying Milhouse to goals and then ""Wasting teacher's valuable time!"", after constantly raising his hand with the wrong answer to answer a question Mrs. Krabappel asked and accused of ""Besmirching an innocent girl's name!"" after trying to flaunt his relationship with Jessica Lovejoy to the other kids. Milhouse claims to care about the environment to impress Lisa. Nelson stands over him with a fist raised and demanded he ""say global warming is a myth!"" Milhouse does so, and Nelson punches him anyway, stating ""That's for selling out your beliefs!"" 
 It is once revealed that Nelson is of German descent. However, he picks on Üter Zörker for being German, during a time when the town was in an anti-illegal immigrant hysteria.
 Secret admiration.  Nelson's enigmatic personality had an impact on many individuals, notably some who try to find good traits in him, if any, and ""convert"" his demeaning character into whatever it is that they see in him. Mrs. Krabappel once tried to make a teacher's pet out of Nelson after he passed a test with A+. Bart was able to befriend him in order to gain popularity, notwithstanding their earlier conflict, which resulted in Nelson bullying Bart even harder at the end. Lisa went out with Nelson for the same reasons, only to be persuaded that he will never change. At some point Nelson teamed up with Martin and attempted to put him straight, therefore not all of his actions are mere intimidation.
 After Season 10, Nelson became portrayed rather as an insecure teenager who is ashamed of his ways and beats kids out of fear that they will find out some piece of his biography he cherishes most, rather than out of fun and boredom. Since his father left the family at that time and Nelson remained with his mother, who is a drunken prostitute, he fears the judgment of others on this and dreams that one day his dad (whom he calls ""papa"") will come home. In several instances, Nelson has visions where he sees his dad and goes up to hug him, but he is actually hugging a tree. Nelson also was revealed to have worn diapers at some point in the episode ""Midnight Rx"" since he says he was grateful to Homer and Abe's drug smuggling operation as it cured his diaper rash.
 Nelson's Dad after he suffered a near-death allergenic reaction and was physically deformed. Nelson and his dad before the physical deformation. Nelson's parents are Eddie Muntz and Mrs. Muntz. His grandfather was a judge.
 Nelson lives in a dilapidated house with his mother, from whom he learned his trademark laugh. The negligent Mrs. Muntz works either as a waitress at Hooters or in a topless bar. In ""Brother from the Same Planet"", Nelson's father appears. It is indicated many times that Nelson's father abandoned Nelson and Mrs. Muntz when he ""went to pick up some cigarettes"", and never returned. Mr. Muntz appears as the children's soccer coach and awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele's Soccer and Acting School.
 At one time, Nelson is adopted by Marge Simpson. To get rid of him, Bart finds Nelson's father and brings him to meet Nelson. It turned out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts and had an allergic reaction. Looking like the Elephant Man, he ran out of the store and encountered a circus that made him a part of its freak show. At performances, audiences threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his allergic reaction, never allowing him to return to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of the needy Nelson, who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge and wouldn't leave. Nelson is the youngest of three siblings including half-brother Norman.
 Nelson having a date with Lisa. Nelson spends quite a lot of his time with other bullies Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. While it was once clear that he was their 'leader', he's spent more time being independently developed as a more sympathetic character, and just as often as not Jimbo can be seen calling the shots now - although Nelson's almost always present when there's a chance to cause trouble for Principal Skinner. He also has two cronies whom he calls The Weasels (rarely seen alongside him after the earlier seasons). Nelson himself was subjected to a beating at the hands of Kearney and Jimbo at the racetrack when he used the word ""guff"" instead of swearing when noting that Furious D, Bart's horse, ""took no guff from nobody"" when exiting the race track to chase off a paparazzi in a violent manner. However, Nelson is shown to be a lot tougher than the other bullies, when protecting Bart and in ""Dial ""N"" for Nerder"" when the other bullies' punches don't hurt Nelson and he doesn't even notice them hitting him.
 Although he does admire Bart and looks up to him like most children of their school, Nelson basically treats him the same as he would most people he bullies. Nelson once described Bart as having ""spiky hair, soft kidneys, and always hitting himself"". Nelson sometimes hangs out with Bart. Indeed, despite Nelson periodically bullying Bart, he is also a frequent participant in many of his schemes, often serving as his muscle man or (to a lesser extent than Milhouse) his right-hand man. It should also be noted that Bart has also beaten Nelson on occasion, such as when he deliberately allowed Martin to sing a girlish song while skipping and pummeled him for this. Bart also beat up Nelson when they were imitating mixed fighting on the playground. In ""The Debarted"", Bart smashed his head with a trash can when Nelson replied ""Yes"" to a question (*the correct answer was ""Yes, sir""). At one point, he also asked Bart if he wanted to play with him in a friendly manner, the implied reason being was that both he and Bart had mothers who were in jail. He also supplied Bart with some advice as well, such as when Bart wanted a little brother despite his parents, or more specifically Homer, refusing, where Nelson suggested that the trick Homer and Marge into getting a younger brother and implied that he based this suggestion on his own mother nearly doing so with Charles Bartley. He also expresses genuine respect after Bart drove a tank into a truck full of schoolbooks due to ""raising the bar for all of "", although he then expressed confusion when Bart called him Caesar, unaware that Bart was addled from negative side-effects from Focusyn.
 Lisa and Nelson kiss in Lisa's Date with Density Nelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendencies, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph, who believe that kissing girls is gay (despite the fact that Jimbo kissed Laura Powers). They stop dating when Lisa finds out that Nelson threw old coleslaw at Principal Skinner's house. He also helps Lisa punish Sherri and Terri for tormenting Lisa about her butt. Their romantic relationship has been referred to several times throughout the series, most notably in the Season 22 episode, ""Loan-a Lisa"" in which Lisa invests in Nelson's business venture. The episode ends with Nelson taking Lisa rollerblading and the pair holding hands. Nelson has even told God ""If you don't bring my Lisa back ants will burn tonight"", in ""The Great Simpsina"". He also admitted that she broke his heart and that he has a fake tattoo of himself on a cross captioned ""Lisa"". He also played a prank on Sherri and Terry as revenge for their making Lisa insecure about her weight (although in this case, it's implied that another reason for it was out of sympathy for Lisa due to having a sister who held similar insecurities about her appearance and may have even died because of it).
 Throughout Tapped Out, when Lisa notices other boys, Nelson shows some jealousy, outright calling them sissies and wimps, and they have plenty of shared tasks that could be classed as 'dates'. Many of these interactions are the result of Premium-based tasks.
 Another curious example of his ""good side"" is with Martin Prince, the school genius, whom he cruelly bullies. However, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any hate towards Martin and only bullies him to maintain his 'tough guy' reputation. Both Nelson and Martin attend Space Camp and it is implied that Martin had helped Nelson quite a bit and the two may have been very friendly.
When it is believed that Martin has died after accidentally falling over a cliff, Nelson seeks to learn the truth and find Martin's alleged killers, adopting an Inspector Columbo demeanor. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but adds he is glad Martin is not dead. While helping rescue the Springfield Lemon Tree, which is in the hands of some kids from Shelbyville, Nelson saves Martin from getting beaten up by a Shelbyville kid, even though he is clearly embarrassed by doing it, but did it so he could maintain Springfield pride.
 Nelson with other bullies He frequently bullies Milhouse, even forcing him to denounce global warming as a myth only to punch him in faux-self-righteous vengeance for ""selling out beliefs"". He once beat up Milhouse severely enough to leave him with a bloody nose, broken glasses, as well as extensive enough internal bleeding that the ambulance people had to fill his ears up with gause to such an extent that he was effectively deaf due to mistaking Lisa's love note to Nelson as being from him (as he acted as a courier for her). However, in some episodes, he is shown to be friends with him. He also sympathized with Milhouse when he learned his parents had recently divorced, due to his own family life when his mom not only divorced his dad, but also cleaned herself to such an extent that his father's scent was no longer present.
 Nelson has only been seen interacting with Bart's mother, Marge, on rare occasions, although they seem to have an awkward, yet at the same time, friendly relationship. Although the two do not interact much (if at all) in the earliest episodes, they do so more often in the later seasons of the series. In Bart the Mother, Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from seeing Nelson, thinking he is a bad influence on them. However, in another episode, she doesn't seem to have anything against him, like when she forced Bart to attend Nelson's birthday party in The Haw-Hawed Couple. Also, in Lisa Simpson, This Isn't Your Life, she claims to be happy to see Bart and Nelson as friends once again. In Sleeping with the Enemy, the two forms a mother-and-son-like bond, which ends up as short-lived, but Nelson and Marge remained friends.
 Nelson has light brown hair, dark brown hair, and dim brown hair and wears a short-sleeved light orange shirt with a dirty, torn light blue vest and blue shorts with matching Mary Jane loafers. Nelson's front teeth are false, and on a removable plate. According to several of the Springfield girls, he is very handsome. 
 Although physically tough, Nelson is not always emotionally tough, as shown in the episode ""The Haw-Hawed Couple"", where after learning Bart had been playing with Milhouse, Nelson finds tears in his eyes. He has a sensitive side as seen when he cried during Andy William's ""Moon River"" rendition in Las Vegas with Bart and the gang.
 He is also very aware of his poverty and frequently has very little food, normally eating tadpoles and on one occasion drywall, this goes to an extreme where he has never even tasted hot dogs before, only ""reading about them in catalogs"". Nelson's home is extremely dilapidated and is not quick to invite people over. An example is in ""Sleeping with the Enemy""; after spending a day with Marge Simpson, she brings him to a broken-down house which she believes is his home, the second she drives away, he gloomily goes next door to an even worse looking house. 
 Nelson daydreaming The most likely cause of Nelson's poor behavior is his low self-esteem, brought on by having a poor relationship with his mother, and a lack of a stable father figure in his life. On one occasion he developed an intimate relationship with Marge who gave him self-respect. He tells Marge ""Thanks lady, for making me feel good about myself"". In his movie entry for the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, he narrates, ""I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.""
 Despite this, Nelson remains aggressive and bullying by nature. While he alienates some with his violent ways, he forces others to be his friends with threats. An example is when he tells his fellow students ""Come to my party or die"" for his birthday; however, when they are persuaded by Bart to not go, he is reduced to tears. The few friends he does have, Nelson is protective towards, such as Bart, who he protected from being bullied by Jimbo. He also saved him from drowning during a field trip. However, this was only because they were field trip buddies, and Bart meant ""barf to him"". When Bart asks Nelson upon the latter being reunited with his father if that means he will stop bullying people, he while implying refusal states he wishes that were possible, indicating that he to some level doesn't wish to bully yet ultimately felt resigned to it.
 He has also engaged in some delinquent behavior, such as burglary and arson, and was also implied to have stolen IDs, as he managed to avoid being ""taken downtown"" for violating curfew by supplying Chief Wiggum with Julius Hibbert's ID.
 Two words Nelson's first word. Nelson's catchphrases are ""Ha-ha!"" (Also spelled as ""Haw-haw!""), ""Aw, crud!"", ""Smell you later!"", and ""Stop hitting yourself!"" The last phrase can be modified to suit the current situation/method of beating, resulting in phrases such as ""Stop endangering yourself!"", ""Stop zapping yourself!"", etc.
 In ""Love, Springfieldian Style"", the story of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen is told by Bart. It stars Nelson as Sid, and notably Lisa as Nancy. The two embark on a tragic and abusive love story fueled by chocolate addiction. However, the story ends with Nelson and Lisa kissing in a garbage-strewn alley before it can reach its real-life conclusion, in which the real Sid was charged with Nancy's murder, and went on to overdose on heroin barely a year later in what most considered a successful suicide attempt. While non-canon it shows that the writers have not yet put aside their previous relationships.
 At age 18, Nelson has dated and impregnated identical twin sisters Sherri and Terri, becoming the father to two sets of identical twins who share his signature laugh. He then claims to be going out to the store for a pack of cigarettes, and then flees, later explaining himself in a similar manner to his father.
 At age 21, Nelson is pushing training equipment into the storage room. He sees Lisa and they talk about their past together and the time they dated. Nelson then takes Lisa back to his house, which is the bell tower of the Memorial Church. The two of them spend the entire night talking to each other and watch the sun rise the next morning. Bart ends up giving Nelson his rent money. Later, Nelson watches Lisa from his bell tower. Lisa leaves town without saying goodbye to him.
 At age 25, Nelson attends Lisa and Hugh Parkfield's wedding along with one of his sons: Nelson Muntz, Jr.
 At age 26, Lisa and Hubert Wong are married and on a train leaving Springfield. Hubert has become a successful technology entrepreneur and became Time Person of the Year. As they talk to each other, Snake is chased by a bounty hunter called Rott. As Snake tries to escape the train, Nelson stops him. Nelson and Lisa reunite again, and Nelson reveals that he and Rott are in a relationship together. Hubert is annoyed to find that Lisa used to have a thing for Nelson, since Nelson used to bully him. The two couples then tell their relationship stories. Hubert proposed to Lisa on the moon, whilst Rott brought Nelson in as he had an overdue library book. When Lisa and Rott leave to get drinks, Hubert rips into Nelson, thinking that his life is so much better than his and that he has the last laugh, since he got Lisa and Nelson didn't. Nelson then wedgies Hubert and hangs him from a coat hook. When Lisa finds Hubert like that, she tells Nelson that he hasn't changed.
 At age 31, Nelson and Lisa meet again in a phone store, owned by Hubert. Nelson reveals that he and Rott broke up, and Lisa reveals that she and Hubert broke up too. The two of them go and get coffee together at Buzz Light Roast and come close to giving a relationship a chance. Before they do though, Hubert teleports in and asks Lisa to take him back because he has changed. Hubert then uses drones to apologize to Lisa, as well as write her graduation speech in the sky. Lisa agrees to take Hubert back after Nelson tells her to go for it. Nelson gets annoyed at himself for letting Lisa go and gives himself a wedgie.
 At age 32, Jimbo and Sophie are getting married and they ask Nelson their best man. He agrees and goes to the wedding. He is surprised to find that Lisa is there. During the wedding, Nelson gets upset and leaves, as he sees the relationship that Jimbo and Sophie have as the relationship he could have had with Lisa. Lisa tells Nelson that she wants to be with him and the two of them kiss.
 At age 40, Nelson is shown to be a rich, powerful businessman (or mob boss) who owns a bar he is still in love with Lisa Simpson. It is implied that the two were almost married, as Lisa asked Bart, ""Should I have married Nelson? ""Cause we still talk on the phone!"", while drunk. Secondly, Nelson talks to Lisa, asking her, ""Is your marriage still dead and unfulfilled?"", implying that the two had an affair. Also, Lisa says to Bart, ""Well, someone calls someone"", when asked, ""Nelson calls you?"", implying that she calls him, rather than he calls her.
 At age 60, an elderly Nelson is seen laughing at Homer Simpson's grave.
 He appeared as the first boss of the game. He generally jumps and causes minor quakes that will stun the player if caught in them, as well as throwing water balloons. To defeat him, the player needs to hit him. Depending on whether the player spelled Maggie's name earlier, the player can either rely solely on water balloons to beat Nelson, or otherwise utilize bowling balls to beat him. It takes eight water balloons/three bowling balls to defeat him.
 He appeared as the boss for the second round of Capture the Flag. The player needs to throw boomerangs at Nelson enough times to knock him out. If the player freed Madman Mort earlier, Mort will appear to pin Nelson long enough to allow the player to have a clear shot at Nelson and take him out easily.
 Aside from being in the background during round transitions alongside Dolph, Kearney, and Jimbo, he also has a voice-only cameo if the player selects Bart as one of the players. When selecting Bart, Nelson can be heard off-screen yelling ""here's your ball, loser!"" and then throwing the bowling ball at Bart hard enough in the gut to force him on his back and then made his trademark laugh, with Bart weakly thanking Nelson.
 He acts as a potential passenger in the game.
 Nelson Muntz appears throughout the game in every level save for the final level (due to zombies replacing all the characters in the street races), where he acts as a referee for car races that were sponsored by the Springfield DMV, and more specifically Selma and Patty Bouvier. He always acts as the second referee for the street races. He repeatedly implies in the first and second level that he was forced to act as referee as part of the sentencing to Community Service, due to being caught selling bootleg CDs on a street corner near Kwik-E-Mart when asked by Homer and Bart what he was doing, as Homer recognized him from his sales (claiming it was either that or reading to the Elderly). When announcing, he proceeds to do a countdown only to end up making a taunt after saying ""two"" before giving the final number. He also claimed that he isn't allowed to beat people while on duty, which he made clear takes some getting used to on his part.
 Aside from his role as a judge for street racing, he also has a fairly major role in the Level 4 mission ""Wolves Stole my Pills"", as he had earlier stolen Abraham Simpson II's crazy pills, and then traded them to someone in a black sedan for the latest Playdude issue, forcing Marge (who needed to talk to Abe to gain information on crop circles) to pursue the car and intercept the pills upon learning this.
 Nelson mostly appears whenever both playable characters are killed off or failed to taunt the player. Nelson is mentioned by Lisa idle in Springfield and the house. a picture of Nelson Appeared in Bartman Begins. Nelson later Sees Hans and tells him to give him his Lunch Money Moleman says that he's an old man Nelson thought he was one of those kids with a disease that makes you look like an old man. Nelson also says that he hates Poeticums, Moleman then gives Him his Lunch Money. Later he meets Gill who says it's really Terrific to talk to him about Singaltion Vynal Siding Nelson says that he was just a kid Nelson was about to punch him but lets him say his A Script. Nelson later Buys the New Itchy and Scratchy Game and attack Marge and Lisa. Nelson laughed at everyone because they were frightened. Manjula came and told Nelson he was a mean little boy and wonders what would his mother say. Nelson replied she wouldn't give a crap and she was shanking her fun bags for money Manjula says that breaks her heart and tells Nelson that does he want to live with her family Nelson thought Manjula meant but she didn't and laughed at Nelson. Nelson was watching on The News on a device about Homer and Bart fighting Lard Lad Nelson Commented and said Ha-Ha. A picture of a Caveman Nelson appeared in NeverQues. Nelson is later mentioned in Medal of Homer when Bart's idle on the ship he says that World War II is scarier then Nelson.
 Nelson has a card in The Simpsons Classic Collection Volume Two.
 ""A riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest, Nelson Muntz is a born bully with a talent for thievin', whose life seems dedicated to teaching all sissy wimps a lesson. Yet beneath Nelson's rough exterior lies a delicate soul longing for a good laugh, as long as the joke's on someone else."" Special offer: A recess and lunch protection package that's very affordable.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" segment Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace, he is terrorized by Groundskeeper Willie in his nightmares. In particular, he had been run over with a floor buffer, causing him to appear exceedingly waxed.
 In Treehouse of Horror X's segment Life's a Glitch, Then You Die, Nelson during the chaos caused by the Y2K glitch is proceeding to use a Xerox to make photocopies of his own butt, only to instantly regret it after the glitch causes him to be sealed within the Xerox machine.
 In Treehouse of Horror XII‘s Wiz Kids segment, Nelson transforms Milhouse into multiple different people as a prank.

Janey Powell,False,False,False,False,False,1,MacNeille,96,"Janey Powell (variously called Janey Henderson in 2006, Janey Jackson in 2013, Jacqueline Jones in 2016) is Lisa Simpson's best friend, or at least the classmate closest to her, and is Lisa's second most frequently appearing classmate after Ralph Wiggum. 
 Janey is noted as ""Lisa's fair-weather best friend"", and this is an accurate description. Though she is often seen hanging out with Lisa, at other times she teases her along with the other children for her misfortunes or idealistic views. (For example, when Lisa first decides to go vegetarian, Janey is one of the first to mock her for it, asking whether Lisa was planning to marry a carrot.) She is not nearly as intelligent or nerdy as Lisa, once blowing a bubble with chewing gum rather than engage in Lisa's current conversation.
 She has spent the night at the Simpsons' house, and Lisa is seen watching cartoons at her house on numerous occasions. She is also seen reading ""The Babysitter Twins"" with Lisa. Janey is also seen to be concerned for Lisa's well-being, one is evident in Separate Vocations, when a depressed and sulky Lisa attempts to enter the girls', bathroom inhibited by rebellious fifth grade girls. She tries to warn Lisa in vain not to enter it, only for her to ignore Janey and enter the bathroom anyway.
 Janey may have had a crush on Milhouse Van Houten, who has a crush on Lisa. In The Simpsons Game, she asks Bart where Milhouse is and calls Lisa cruel for leading Milhouse on. She sells cupcakes in school. She also said that Milhouse doesn't like Lisa when other students were mocking them about it, which made the students mock her for liking Milhouse instead.
 According to The Lisa Book, Janey is considered to be one of the most popular girls in second grade, in a poll that she conducted herself. She is very fashion-conscious, being particularly wary of clothes that look Canadian. She also enjoys the company of other girls, especially when they fawn on her. From Janey's perspective, either you're with her or you have ""cooties"".
 Janey wears a pink or purple dress with a white collar, pink or purple ankle high socks, and white shoes. She has dark brown hair and brown skin. In The Burns Cage, she had her hair in a ponytail, using a hair tie.
 In ""Future-Drama"", Janey is at the senior prom despite being a junior.
 She is shown as the specter of George Washington's reluctant second choice for first female President after Lisa disappoints him, to which Lisa fiercely objected on the grounds Janey would just fill the Supreme Court with boys.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror IV"" segment, Bart Simpson's Dracula she is shown as vampire.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XXVII"", segment BFF R.I.P. she is playing hide and seek with Lisa when Ned Flanders's lawn mower suddenly turns on and kills her.

Julius Hibbert,True,True,False,True,False,2,Richardson,98,"Dr. Julius Michael Hibbert, M.D., better known as Dr. Hibbert, is Springfield's most prominent and competent doctor, though he sometimes makes no effort to hide or make light of his high prices. Hibbert is very good-natured and is known for finding a reason to laugh at nearly every situation. He is often assisted by Dr. Nick Riviera. He is a minor character in The Simpsons Movie. Julius Hibbert with his wife, Bernice 
Dr. Hibbert is the Simpson's kind-hearted family doctor, a genius, a graduate of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Mensa member. As an undergraduate, it is inferred that he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. Hibbert is noticeably less dysfunctional than just about everyone else, though he does have a bizarre tendency to chuckle at inappropriate moments. He also gives questionable solutions to certain medical problems. For example, when Maggie saved Homer from drowning, he replied to Marge's question about how a baby can save the life of a full-grown man, saying ""It's very simple. When an adult's life is in danger, a child can summon superhuman strength!"" When Homer challenged Red Barclay to eat the ""Sir Loins-A-Lot"" steak in a contest, Marge feared that Homer might choke on a part of the steak, while Dr. Hibbert claimed that since being 12% owner of The Slaughterhouse (the restaurant they were eating at), his dietary advice suggests ""the occasional eating contest"". However, when Red dies from ""beef poisoning"", he attributes the cause to another restaurant. He also runs Dr. Julius Hibbert, M.D. Family Practice to which he showed Lisa a video about DNA. Dr. Julius Hibbert, m.d. Hibbert's hairstyle when Marge had Maggie. There are hints that Dr. Hibbert is not above dubious medical practices either. After Marge talks him out of buying an unsuitable house, he tells her if she ever needs a prescription, ""no questions asked..."" On another occasion, he buys one of Bart's T-Shirts with the legend ""DO NOT RESUSCITATE"" remarking that it could get him out of some sticky situations. When he realized that Marge was initially unenthusiastic about having a third child, he implied that a healthy baby could bring in as much as $60,000 on the black market. Hibbert covered for himself against Marge's horrified reaction by saying that if she had replied any other way, she would be sent to prison, claiming that it was ""just a test"". In addition, Dr. Hibbert often has problems of what he should say to the patients, sometimes making the situation seem far worse than it actually was. A notable instance is when, after Bart was injured from a pool-dive gone awry, he told Bart ""I'm sorry, but that leg's gonna have to come off"", implying that Bart's broken leg will need to be amputated, only for him to correct himself and state that his wet bathing suit has to come off.
 Springfield General Hospital where Dr. Hibbert is usually seen Despite his seemingly honest and good-hearted personality, there is evidence that he is, at heart, a committed mercenary. Hibbert announces to Homer that his heart operation will cost $30,000. When Homer has a heart attack in front of him in response to this news, he says, unmoved, ""I'm afraid it's now $40,000"" (hinting that instead of a triple bypass, it became a quadruple bypass). After Homer's baby-proofing business eliminates child injuries in Springfield, Hibbert is seen holding a cooing infant and complaining that there are not any scratches on him, and he has got boat payments. Hibbert is once shown as running an ""H.M.O"" (""Hibbert's Money-Making Organization""). He has also been interviewed on television sporting a baseball cap and chain blatantly advertising the wares of pharmaceutical companies. The ""interview"" ends with him joining in a choreographed raunchy dance routine with several attractive female dancers promoting Pfizer products. He is a committed Republican and attends Springfield's Republican meetings alongside Mr. Burns and Rainier Wolfcastle. Hibbert also freely wears fur coats, believing that while fur itself may not be murder, ""paying for it sure is!""
 While Hibbert is usually competent and responsible, it was once suggested that he did not have a legal license in medicine, since when Lisa was going to say who has been practicing medicine without a license (who is actually Homer), Hibbert tugs his collar nervously. In addition, he once tricked Homer into signing a malpractice waiver, after his medication caused Bart to lose his hearing, by making him ""test out his signature"" on the waiver. It has also been strongly hinted that his habit of inappropriate laughter at times is the result of a current morphine addiction.
 Hibbert discovers a crayon in Homer's brain There is some evidence of serious incompetence on the part of Doctor Hibbert. It is once revealed that the reason the crayon in Homer's brain was never discovered was because he covered up the crayon with his thumb, thereby suggesting he was not even looking at Homer's x-rays before picking them up. Also, Doctor Hibbert once checks Sideshow Bob's pulse before pronouncing him dead, then he throws Bob's hand away because he is touching a dead person. There were also instances where he came up with creative solutions to get his patients to undergo medical treatment, only for it to backfire horribly. A notable instance is where he had various townspeople disguise themselves as him to tail Bart so he could give him a Flu Shot, but ended up as a consequence banned from the library for a very lewd action that Moe Szyslak did while acting as one of his doubles.
 One of Hibbert's hairstyles His hairstyle has varied over the years (Afro, dreadlocks, Mr. T-style Mohawk, etc.), appropriate for the time period. At least one of Hibbert's cars is a green Mercedes-Benz G500, he also had a silver Volvo 850 sedan, and he once mentioned his Porsche keys. He was seen muttering angrily over a ""rusty tailgate"" on a generic-looking station wagon. His hobbies include Judo.
 He and his family live next to the Wiggum family.
 Dr. Hibbert supposedly attended Johns Hopkins University, and evidence indicates he was probably born in Alabama. To pay for medical college, he performed as a male stripper under the pseudonym ""Malcolm Sex"", claiming he would ""satisfy the ladies by any means necessary"". He has since been seen running an adult education class in ""How to Strip for Your Wife"", which Homer briefly attended.
 Hibbert uncharacteristically unamused Hibbert is recognized by his deep, bombastic voice and signature jovial chuckle, usually at inappropriate times such as delivering bad news to a patient. Whilst most doctors are supposed to empathetic and serious, Hibbert finds mostly everything to be funny. However, there have been a few instances where even Hibbert himself didn't find something to be funny. For example when he was given a T-Shirt at a speedway racetrack and was unamused after reading the fine print, amazing his wife who noticed he usually laughed at everything. Also, when he expelled Homer from his male stripping class, Homer asked if he was going to chuckle but Hibbert replied in a serious tone ""there's nothing to chuckle about"".  He also takes people's health seriously, such as the time when Bart became overweight and had a heart attack, he told Marge and Homer that it was Bart's fault for having this condition and once he gets home will have to go on a strict diet and exercise. Also he strictly refused to give Moe a height-reduction surgery, stating he was asking for something completely unethical, unlike Dr. Nick.
 Hibbert's practices are usually sought out by the rest of Springfield's citizens as he is one of the few licensed and experienced doctors in the town but until recently some have found his medical advice and Hibbert himself to be dubious. His suggestion to cut off Homer's other thumb when his right one was severed to gain symmetry on nth hands led Marge to believe that Hibbert was ""losing it"".
 Hibbert validates Marge's parking His ambiguity in medical practices is also displayed by how he constantly assures that his patients are well-funded before he helps them, rather in backhand or sneaky ways such as telling an unenthusiastic Marge about her third baby that it will cost 60,000 dollars to raise a healthy child and judges her next action to treat with her based on her reaction to this news, claiming she would be in jail if it went differently. He was also prepared to suck Marge through a tube from his ceiling if she didn't have insurance and when Homer had a heart attack following the news that his quadruple bypass will cost 30,000 dollars, raised it to 40,000 after the heart attack. Hibbert is willing to use backhand tactics to make sure he is not sued when his medical duplicity catches up with him such as tricking Homer into signing a form that absolves him of consequence for Bart going deaf, after Hibbert had ruthlessly hunted him down to inoculate him in the first place and when he sneakily validated Marge's parking so he could not be sued for submitting the sane Homer to electro-shock therapy.
 He has two brothers, both of them long-lost from birth, Hermano Hibbert who was the head of Shelbyville orphanage and Bleeding Gums Murphy who ironically met with each other in hospital and described themselves but failed to realize the connection.
 A young Bleeding Gums Murphy The director of the Shelbyville orphanage Dr. Hibbert's daughter and son Dr. Hibbert is married; he and his wife Bernice have five children, three sons and two daughters. They have never been named in the series, with the exception of his first son JJ. When his entire family is seen together, they appear to be similar to The Cosby Show. His marriage seems to have some problems according to some moments together, such as being filmed by the ""Kiss cam"" at the stadium and Hibbert saying they don't like public relations. Also, there are hints that, at the very least, he was unfaithful to his wife, as Dr. Hibbert once hosted, or at the very least participated in, a Key party, where it is implied that he was paired up with Luann Van Houten, and attempted to get a departing Homer and Marge to stay by saying ""Come on, you're missing all the sex!""
 It is implied that he and Bleeding Gums Murphy are long-lost half-brothers; Hibbert says he has a long-lost brother who is a jazz musician, and Murphy says he has a brother who is a doctor that chuckles at inappropriate times, but somehow the two don't put these clues together. Hibbert also bears a striking resemblance to the director of the Shelbyville orphanage, who mentions a personal quest to find his long-lost twin to an indifferent Homer.
 He owns a poodle named Rosa Barks who was impregnated by Santa's Little Helper. Unhappy with a litter of greyhound/poodle puppies, Dr. Hibbert left the puppies in the care of the Simpson family. Lisa and Bart distributed the puppies around Springfield. The known recipients of the puppies were Krusty, Snake and Groundskeeper Willie.
 In the first segment of ""Treehouse of Horror VIII"", he survives the nuclear France had launched on Springfield but horribly mutated.
 Mutant Hibbert In the first segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XI"", he comes to the Simpson house to observe the cause of Homer's death.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XIII"", segment ""The Island of Dr. Hibbert"", he inhabits a skull-shaped island, where he transforms all of his visitors into animals. The final citizen of Springfield to undergo this fate was Homer Simpson.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XV"", segment ""Ned Zone"", he falls to his death after Homer asks him to collect a Frisbee from the window-sill.
 In the final segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XVI"", he is turned a vampire by a witch and later into a Pacifier by Maggie Simpson.
 In the final segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XVIII"", he is seen confronting Homer along with several other Springfield residents about his children's pranks (along with Milhouse and Nelson).
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XXVIII"", segment ""The Exor-Sis"", he was killed by Maggie Simpson possessed by Pazuzu demon, she also reveals he cheated on his wife.
 In ""Lisa's Wedding"", he appears at the wedding of Lisa Simpson and Hugh Parkfield, where he states that Maggie is quite the hellion but she does have an incredible voice to Krusty.
 At the end ""Three Gays of the Condo"", which takes place many years in the future Doctor Hibbert is viewing his old video tapes all of which he left and finds out the nurse did steal sponges, thus proving he was right.
 In ""Future-Drama"", he is seen sitting in attending a Springfield High School ceremony for one of his children along with his wife.
 In ""Beware My Cheating Bart"", he is mentioned to have died from a fall by an Elderly Homer and Marge.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", a nurse asks Dr. Hibbert if they should start an epidural on Maggie Simpson, but Dr. Hibbert gives her a pacifier which helps her while she is in labor.
 In ""Days of Future Future"", he treats Milhouse Van Houten's zombism.
 Julius Hibbert runs a surgery center and barber shop, where he tells that Krusty the Clown went here, where he found out that he had genital snerfs hidden near his genitals, much to his annoyance. Not long later, Homer and Marge brought Jacqueline Bouvier here because Marge discovered that her hand was blue and cold earlier. Dr. Hibbert notices this, and reveals that Jacqueline's blue and cold hand was caused by a bite from an Ice Walker.
 Although he wasn't originally based on Bill Cosby's character Dr. Cliff Huxtable from The Cosby Show, when the Fox network moved The Simpsons to Thursdays opposite NBC's top-rated The Cosby Show, the staff made Hibbert more of a parody of Huxtable. Hibbert even owns a collection of rather horrid sweaters, just like Dr. Huxtable. Hibbert is always given a new hairdo in flashback appearances, such as an Afro, dreads or a Mr. T-like Mohawk.
 A tongue-in-cheek analysis in the Canadian Medical Association Journal compares the services of Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick Riviera, a quack physician often used by the Simpsons as a cheaper alternative source of medical advice. While Dr. Hibbert is praised for his sense of humor and quality of care.

Captain Lance Murdock,True,False,False,False,False,2,Castellaneta,99,"Captain Lance Murdock is a professional stunt devil who broke every single bone in his body while doing his stunts. One stunt had him jumping a pool filled with Great White Sharks, Electric Eels, a school of Piranhas, alligators, and one lion, as well as the water itself containing an element of human blood. Although he got through the stunt itself in one piece, he ended up clumsily falling in while basking in the glory afterward, swimming to the edge only to be pulled back in by a lion, and had to be netted out by paramedics and put on a stretcher, barely surviving. He inspired Bart Simpson to become a daredevil and convinced him personally to jump over Springfield Gorge on a skateboard. After Homer ended up hospitalized after he had inadvertently jumped the gorge in Bart's place in an attempt to stop him (as well as falling down the gorge again due to the ambulance driving into a tree), he ended up being the neighboring patient of Lance Murdock, with Homer bitterly telling him ""You think you've got guts? Try raising my kids!""
 Murdock later reappeared to do a stunt at Las Vegas. Homer decided to volunteer, as Ned Flanders was unwilling to risk his life for the stunt. The stunt was for him to go through rings of fire, ice, and dog poo while unlocking a safe box combination. He ends up seriously injured due to Homer getting up BEFORE the stunt was completed (although apparently having survived, given the fact that the announcer said, ""He's all right!"").
 When Homer was breaking bad news to a woman about her husband over Springfield Gorge, when he told her the bad news, she fainted and fell into the gorge and landed on Murdock's motorcycle that he was using doing a stunt. They both presumably died or were seriously injured because of the extra weight. Homer told his family the story and after Lisa asked if they made it, Homer replied, “No...big crash. Less said, the better.”

Elizabeth Hoover,False,False,False,True,True,2,Gaven,100,"Elizabeth Gunderson, B.Ed. (née Hoover; also known as Miss Hoover) is a recurring character on The Simpsons. She is a second-grade teacher at Springfield Elementary School.
 Mrs. Hoover with blue hair Miss Hoover has been worn down by her years in the public school system and is therefore unable to retain an enthusiastic attitude during her job, although she does show premises of it on some occasions. As much as Hoover is concerned for the future of the children (as opposed to Edna, who doesn't seem to care the slightest), she hates her job and seems overwhelmed with stress, seeking whatever remedies she can to alleviate it. Hoover is often seen smoking even while teaching, even under a ""No Smoking"" sign in the assembly hall. She also occasionally drinks on the job. Once she was granted tenure, she willingly turned over her teaching responsibilities to Ralph Wiggum.
 Her desperate attempts to regain her stability include rushing out of class to recite ""Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean"" with her eyes closed, and even, on two occasions, getting into her car and driving off (although one of those instances also had to do with a teacher's strike that Edna proposed).
 She was replaced by a substitute teacher, Mr. Bergstrom, when she thought of being diagnosed with Lyme disease. It turned out that her condition was psychosomatic, which the kids thought meant that she was ""faking it"" and ""crazy"", with her admitting that it was ""a bit of both.""
 She seems to have a better handle on Bart that Edna does, but this can be attributed to the fact that she likely was his teacher back when he was in second grade.
 She also seemed to be dangerously unaware of how a teacher is supposed to act and is gullible at times relating to teaching. This trait was especially evident when Homer Simpson, who was a newly-made teacher at the Springfield Adult Education center, was speeding and driving through red lights while behaving as though being a teacher made him entitled to do such a thing: Hoover, who briefly witnessed, and heard, Homer's behavior, felt that she must be entitled to do the same thing, and began to do the same reckless behavior. She also was not above sleeping in class, which Nelson Muntz once exploited by doodling a message saying ""Insert Booze Here"" with an arrow pointing to her mouth. She also appears to be somewhat resistant to injury, as she was hurled head-first out of the teachers lounge during a massive brawl after Mike said Edna's fourth grade students suck, but simply got back up, straightened her blouse and went back inside to resume fighting. Despite her negative attitude towards teaching, she has demonstrated considerable skill in math, being able to calculate 926 dollars simply by leafing through them - though this could also be meant to imply that she has extensive experience with illicit, cash-only transactions.
 In The Simpsons Game, Miss Hoover is one of two characters that doesn't have any lines, even whilst exploring the town; the other being Lunch-lady Doris.
 She becomes a character in The Simpsons Tapped Out, coming with the Ah, Fudge! Factory and Cocoa Beanie.
 In ""Future-Drama"", she can be seen in Moe's Tavern with Edna Krabappel when Homer Simpson and Bart Simpson attempt to look for females.
 In ""Days of Future Future"", she is one of the many women Bart has a relationship with.
 At the end of ""Flanders' Ladder"", she is shown to be one of the many wives of Ned Flanders.
 In the second segment, Dial ""M"" for Murder or Press ""#"" to Return to Main Menu, she picks a student other than Lisa to represent the class at a reading roundup. Lisa's enraged response causes Miss Hoover to give her detention where she and Bart concoct a plan to get revenge on their  teachers. Lisa ding-dong-ditches Mrs. Krabappel, but Bart kills Miss Hoover.
 Miss Hoover is voiced by Maggie Roswell, and was temporarily voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven while Roswell was involved in a salary dispute.
 In her initial appearances in season 2 and 3, her hair is bright blue, barring Lisa's Substitute, Bart the Lover and Homer at the Bat, where it is light brown, and Bart the Murderer, where it is orange. From season 4 onwards, brown becomes the norm.

Edna Krabappel,False,False,False,True,True,1,stars,103,"Edna Krabappel was a recurring character and a fourth grade teacher at Springfield Elementary School up until her unspecified death in 2013.
 She lived at 82 Evergreen Terrace, but later moved to 744 Evergreen Terrace, after marrying Ned Flanders, the widower of Maude Flanders. Outside school, Edna was portrayed as a typical mid-life single adult, heavy smoker, gambler, and occasional solitary drinker trying to find the right man. She had numerous affairs with many Springfieldians; her recurring choice always being Principal Skinner, usually out of pity rather than affection. From Season 23 until her retirement in Season 25, Edna Krabappel was married to Ned Flanders. She was 41 years old and she was born in 1949.
 Al Jean announced Edna would be retired due to the death of Marcia Wallace (her voice actress) on October 25, 2013. The process began in ""Four Regrettings and a Funeral"" when ""We'll really miss you Mrs. K."" was shown on the chalkboard gag during the title sequence, which premiered nine days after Marcia's death. In the Season 25 episode ""The Man Who Grew Too Much"", Ned and Nelson mentioned that they miss her. Her passing was indicated by Ned wearing a black armband, but was never shown on-screen.
 Born in Springfield on January 21‚ 1949 she was an A-grade student back in school and held a Master's in education from Bryn Mawr College. Her life dream once was to teach to young students; however, after years of teaching jaded her positive image, and after her husband left for another woman, their marriage counselor, Edna started drinking her days away. She got fired from teaching in a prestigious private school, and eventually made her way into Springfield Elementary. From then on, she was portrayed as a caricature of the American public school system, as evidenced on the occasion when Lisa steals all the teachers' editions of the textbooks (which contain the answers). Moreover, dealing with Bart Simpson and his shenanigans did nothing but aggravate Edna's apathy.
 Edna apparently did come from Springfield, as she can be seen running through the background in Springfield High School when Clancy Wiggum is being videotaped as a hall monitor, suggesting that she probably left Springfield young but returned when unable to keep up with her dream life. Moreover, she graduated from Springfield University.
 Krabappel, like many other teachers at Springfield Elementary School, smoked heavily, especially during school hours. It was also implied that Edna Krabappel drank heavily, as when Marge arrived at the school to use a restroom and noticed Edna sleeping in class and uttering ""stupid hangover"".
 During her more recent years at Springfield Elementary School, in general, Edna didn't care at all about teaching the children properly anymore. Edna was usually annoyed by her straight-A student Martin Prince. Her attitude towards her class ranged from a bit of fondness to open dislike. She was known to remark that her students would end up in blue-collar jobs, such as gas station attendants. Edna fought hard for improved materials, leading a strike against Principal Skinner. During class time, Edna presented material in a monotone, apathetic manner, indifferent to the children's disinterest.
 ""Four Regrettings and a Funeral"" chalkboard gag. Edna was usually shown to be involved with many activities around Springfield. She was a member of the Investorettes. She was also a member of Marge's book club, although nobody in the club seems to read the book they are supposed to. Edna seemed to be friends with fellow teacher Elizabeth Hoover, as they were often seen smoking together and often made comments and criticisms about the state of Springfield Elementary to each other. When Edna thought she had met her dream man through a personal ad, Miss Hoover seemed to be her confidante; Edna showed her the letters and discussed what she would do on future dates.
 She seemed to get along with Lisa, as seen in ""Treehouse of Horror XX"".
 Edna had short brown hair with the most upper part being a bit puffy. She usually wore spiraling earrings, a thin green jacket with a lighter green undershirt, a dark turquoise skirt, and dark green low-heeled shoes.
 Edna as an online game character. The most recurring theme about Krabappel was her non-existent love life, and as a result, loneliness and desire for a partner. She is divorced; her first husband ran off with their marriage counselor. She did talk about her ex living somewhere else exotic, but at one time, a man at the local gas station, while diagnosing a fault with her car, tasted sugar in the gasoline and states ""Your ex-husband strikes again!"" As a result, she severely missed a man's love and the cozy delights of couple-hood and partnership, and it was occasionally implied that she felt her biological clock ticking. At one point, it was shown that her first husband was a drunk, and she hated bars and taverns because of it. She was shown as very sexually aggressive: she tried to pick up Joey Kramer (Aerosmith's drummer). She had an on-again-off-again relationship with Principal Seymour Skinner and once had sex in the backseat of her car with a sushi chef. She can be seen at a Green Day concert on top of Seymour's shoulders wearing a T-shirt saying ""Not my boyfriend"" with an arrow pointing down at Skinner in The Simpsons Movie. She also had a relationship with Comic Book Guy (whom she almost married) and a pen pal who she believed was the man of her dreams, Woodrow.  It was revealed later that Woodrow was Bart writing fake love letters to Krabappel (that was in fact the plot of one of the episode's stories).
 It is shown in a flashback that she was in a serious relationship with Moe Szyslak when she first moved to Springfield, before meeting Skinner or even becoming a teacher. She was about to run away with him (and possibly get married) but then changed her mind when she met Bart Simpson, a student she believed needed help. (This story may or may not be canonical, as it was part of a tale told second-hand or possibly made up) Indeed, Krabappel appeared to be the object of many a man's desire, as evident by Sideshow Bob's outrage when his romantic date with her is ruined by a spying Bart: ""You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel!"" One time, during an ""edutainment"" show at Springfield Elementary School, she did a balloon dance wearing nothing but balloons while she popped them to the tune of ""Fever"", Mortifying the audience (especially Bart, who even went as far as to say ""Kill me!"" from witnessing it). This event was also implied to have driven Homer to steal concessions as compensation for having to sit through and watch it (or as he put it to Lisa, ""I saw Krabappel's butt. I paid!"") She often had dinner at The Pimento Grove with her on-again, off-again dates. She was also seen kissing Jacques on camera footage in Burns' Surveillance Room. She once danced with Bart in ""Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind"".  
 
In ""Ned 'N Edna's Blend"", she married Ned Flanders. From then on until her death, she was referred to simply as ""Edna"", so it is unknown if she kept the last name Krabappel, took Ned's surname, or chose a hyphenated name like Krabappel-Flanders. Edna making herself up. At the end of ""The Man Who Grew Too Much"", Ned is shown remembering a happy memory of dancing with Edna. He then looks at the picture of her next to the one of Maude, saying sadly that he misses her laugh. Outside, Nelson laughs, then admits he misses her too. The black armband Ned is wearing shows Edna had died some time previously as they generally mark the remembrance of a deceased person. Edna's death had been hinted at earlier in Season 25 in ""Four Regrettings and a Funeral"" when a sad Bart wrote, ""We'll really miss you Mrs. K."" only one time on the chalkboard during the opening sequence. The episode premiered on November 3, 2013, nine days after Marcia Wallace's death. In ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"", her gravestone is finally shown; it has written the iconic phrase ""Ha!"" on it. She had died from being hit by Homer’s car.
 While she has dated many men and was married to Ned Flanders, in ""The Ned-liest Catch"", it is revealed she dated Patty Bouvier once. When Ned is about to kiss Edna in an episode, he envisions all the other people she has kissed. Patty's face comes up and says it was an ""experiment""...
 Edna Krabappel was defined by her cynicism, short temper, loneliness, and uncaring attitude towards her students. Like nearly all of the teachers of Springfield Elementary, she constantly butted heads with fourth-grade juvenile delinquent, Bart Simpson. Despite this, Bart and Edna were close friends at heart, so much that he nominated her for Teacher of the Year and they went to a movie with one another when she was depressed that Skinner had blown her off. Edna is quite the disciplinarian at times, an example of this would be when the new yo-yo craze overran her classroom and in response, she confiscated the toys, but despite this, she is normally quite ignorant towards their well-being or concerns.
 Edna had something of a reputation among the other teachers. She was a sexually-experienced woman and was not above using her own sexuality to reel in guys. A good example of this is when she was writing to her ""boyfriend"" Woodrow and delivered a very appealingly sultry picture of herself. Edna's reputation is revealed when Lisa and Bart were sent to the third grade and the teacher (non-discreetly) coughed over her breath ""slut"" while referring to her and while showing her students a sex education video Edna remarked that ""she's faking it"". However, despite this, Edna is a lonely and depressive woman, such as shown when she tried to bargain the students to stay behind by saying she'll do their homework and such was further shown when she tried to get a hot date and to be only met with a dial tone. It causes her to pound her fist on the table and yell ""I NEED A MAN!""
 Edna was a woman of vice. She enjoyed smoking cigarettes (even in class which was banned by school laws) and was something of a heavy drinker and normally taught classes with a hangover. She made no effort in hiding her dislike of children and was normally left very irritated by her star student, Martin Prince. Edna displayed a mostly sarcastic denouement, normally using jabs or biting quips towards students. She wasn't normally aggressive towards children, but if her temper was pushed to its limits, Edna would lash out. Even this was very rare, as the only time that she was violent towards students was when she slapped Bart Simpson square across the back of the head.
 She was originally married to Mr. Krabappel, but their marriage ended in divorce after he apparently ran off with their marriage counselor, Edna was later engaged to Seymour Skinner, who she almost married in Season 15, but rejected him after she realized he was unwilling to commit to her. Edna's second husband was Ned Flanders, whom she began dating at the start of Season 22 and married in Season 23, and they remained together until Edna was killed off, following her voice actor's death at the hiatus of Season 25 and Season 26 in summer 2013.
 In ""Bart Gets an ""F"""", where Bart has a vision where he is held back in fourth grade for many years. An elderly Mrs. Krabappel asks Bart Sr. for the name of the pirate in Treasure Island. When he cannot come up with the name, Bart Jr. whispers the proper name, Long John Silver, to his father. Mrs. Krabappel says she wants to speak to both Bart Simpsons after class. This is clearly non-canonical, only being a figment of Bart's nightmare.
 In ""Lisa's Wedding"", Edna is seen at Lisa's wedding and Selma Bouvier threatens to stuff her hat down her throat if she catches the bouquet. Similarly, Maude Flanders also appears at the wedding, since this episode was produced and released before either character had been written out of the series.
 In ""Future-Drama"", she is seen at Moe's Tavern with Elizabeth Hoover when Homer and Bart attempt to find women but only find Edna and Ms. Hoover.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", it is implied that Homer killed Edna. She also appears on Lisa's Ultranet friend requests.
 Edna has spoken alive after her actress's death in ""Yolo"".
 Her last name is pronounced crah-bopple and is a play on the fruit ""crabapple"" and it is also a reference to the teacher Miss Crabtree from the 1930s Little Rascals series. Part of the original joke of her last name was that nobody ever mispronounced her name and called her ""Miss Crabapple"", Milhouse was the first to make this joke which had the other students in class amazed and feeling stupid for not noticing it before. In ""Grade School Confidential"", Homer mentions that he had called her ""Crandall"" for quite some time.
 Marcia Wallace had provided the voice for Edna but died October 25, 2013, due to pneumonia-related breast cancer. Al Jean has stated that the character of Edna would be retired. In Holidays of Future Passed, Ned mentions that Edna was killed by Homer; however, future episodes are usually non-canon. As such, her cause of death has not yet been determined nor revealed.
 In ""Left Behind"" and ""Diary Queen"", she is voiced using archive audio saying the line, ""Remember, if you can teach one kid one thing, then today will be a success."" from a previous episode when Bart tells Ned that he hopes that he can be as good as a teacher as Edna and when Bart reads Edna's diary.

Martin Prince,True,True,False,False,False,1,Castellaneta,104,"Martin with his WANG Computers shirt seen in Treehouse of Horror IV. Martin Prince, Jr. is a recurring character in The Simpsons. He is a friend and classmate of Bart Simpson, and rivals Lisa's intelligence. He is Nelson Muntz's favorite target for bullying and is an academically brilliant teacher's pet and is portrayed as a stereotypical nerd. Martin is a fourth-grade student at Springfield Elementary School. He is usually shown on friendly terms with Bart since he is occasionally seen with him, along with Milhouse, Nelson, and a few other kids.
 Martin raising his hand Martin is the son of Gareth and Gloria, and he has an older brother Montaigne. He is an academically brilliant student. He is also portrayed as a teacher's pet with the stereotypical nerd enthusiasms for science fiction, role-playing games, and not-so-great fashion sense. He has an IQ (Intelligence Quotience) of 216. Because he is the class nerd, he unwittingly becomes the perfect target for ruthless bullying at Springfield Elementary School. He is a member of the Springfield band and is often seen with a French Horn. Martin often says ""Behold!"", ""Pick me, teacher, I'm ever so smart!"" and ""Excelsior!""
 Martin bullying a boy Given Martin's fawning behavior towards adults and condescension towards his peers (such as successfully petitioning to have the school day extended by 20 minutes), quite alot of Springfield tend to cheer on his tormentors. An example of this is when Mrs. Krabappel assigns a World War I paper. Martin asks if he can type his report and then if it can be ten pages (minimum). Martin disappears almost immediately and Nelson lets the not particularly concerned teacher know that ""he's gone now"". Despite this behavior, Martin tries to be friendly with Nelson. Martin is somewhat overweight, as noted by Abraham Simpson. He is sent to the weight loss section of the hellish Kamp Krusty. Although his father calls it ""image enhancement camp"", Martin notices some right through this, shouting ""Spare me your euphemisms! It's fat camp for daddy's chubby little secret!"". 
 Early design of Martin Prince Martin's hair puffed up/sabotaged by Bart Simpson One time, Bart challenged Martin for the presidency of the class. Martin, of course, has a comprehensive (though not particularly politically well-judged) platform which Bart, with the aid of Homer, picks apart with populist nonsense. In a debate, Martin begins to speak of the high level of asbestos in the classrooms, and Bart interrupts and says ""That's not enough! We want more asbestos! More Asbestos!"" leaving the entire class chanting the slogan. Nevertheless, Bart still loses the election as Martin and his running mate Wendell are the only ones in the class who bothered to vote on election day.
 Despite the natural animosity between Bart and Martin, there are plenty of times the two have often joined forces. Sometimes they even appear friends and will work together once it's necessary to. Once Martin tutored Bart in exchange for lessons about being cool (although Martin betrayed Bart at the end of their collaboration). Martin and Bart have also worked together on a soapbox racer. Bart, Martin, and Milhouse all pool their money to buy a copy of the first Radioactive Man comic (although both Milhouse and Bart think he is trying to steal it so tie they him to a chair). Also, when Bart was forced to wear corrective lenses, leg supports, and temporarily appears quite nerdy, he becomes an even greater target for bullying. During this time, Martin and a group of nerds befriend him until he no longer has to wear these glasses or boots. When kids from Shelbyville steal Springfield's lemon tree, Martin teams up with Bart as part of the gang of raiders who seek to take the lemon tree back (Bart describes him as the gang's smart guy). Martin's closest friends are apparently Wendell, Database, and the German exchange student Üter, who he bears a resemblance to.
 Martin imagining being a professional basketball player During one spring break, Martin accompanies Bart, Nelson, and Milhouse on a chaotic road trip to Knoxville, Tennessee. Bart is not really extremely harsh on Martin (although, he mistakenly refers to him as ""Milton"" and is subsequently corrected by Milhouse) most of the time, but Martin can get out of control. Aside from being a bit snobbish, Martin once became a bad boy, up to the point of being even worse than Bart. He once slapped Bart on the head when Bart was sad that Homer didn't support him, and once threateningly held a small Shelbyville kid up against a tree.
 Martin playing the flute As time went on, Bart has become less and less hostile with Martin to the point of total neutrality, but this did not stop or prevent Springfield Elementary's bullies from continuing their traditional beating. Martin also has become more passive and less condescending. He is often depicted as too passive, since even Lisa can be a bit harsh to him, such as an event in which Lisa is initially blamed by Sherri and Terri for being responsible for stranding the group of children on a deserted island because she helped set up the disastrous field trip. Lisa, in turn, states that Martin seconded the trip, and because of that it's his fault. Martin has been known to casually hang out with Bart's group from time to time as well, and is often seen with Bart and Milhouse in the background. He is also occasionally seen with Ralph Wiggum. Martin also sits directly in front of Bart in their fourth-grade class. Although they often work together on various school projects and classwork, it is implied in many episodes that Martin and Lisa are also rivals, especially when it comes to the Science Fair. Martin is seen grinning at the back of the bus, as it rides off without her. He proclaims that without Lisa there to grab the first prize badge, he will receive first place, despite her IQ being 158, and his being 216.
 At the climax of The Simpsons Movie, as Homer and Bart attempt to save Springfield by throwing Russ Cargill's bomb outside of the giant glass dome encasing the entire town, Martin approaches his usual tormentors, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney, screaming I've been taking your crap all my life!. He then picks up a wooden two by four and beats them up as long-overdue revenge.
 Martin was once charged with throwing a brick through a pharmacy window and looting prescription drugs, where he, along with Bart, Nelson, and Dolph, were sent on a trip to the highlands. During the trip, Dolph and Nelson are captured and are rescued thanks to Martin.
 
The sexuality of Martin was initially the subject of various jokes and innuendos, although he has since denied being gay.   Martin giving himself a wedgie from a coat hanger Martin has light brown ginger hair and a long mouth and nose. He usually wears a white collared short-sleeved shirt with pens in the front pocket, brown short pants, white short socks, and black one-strap shoes.
 Martin the victim of bullying Martin is Nelson's favorite bullying target. He is often inflicting numerous painful acts of bullying on him. In ""The Squirt and the Whale"" he is giving Martin a wedgie in an alley, causing Martin to make a very high-pitched sounding noise. Nelson is also seen giving him a noogey in ""Lost Verizon"". In ""Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts"" Nelson uses Martin as a lock-on for the door by taping his hands together. He was also seen tossing tomatoes at him with fellow bullies, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney while a helpless Martin was dangling from the bleachers by his tied up feet. In ""Lemon of Troy"", he saves Martin from getting beat up by a Shelbyville kid, but Nelson appears embarrassed about it and claims he doesn't normally hang out with him. When Martin is supposedly killed in ""Dial ""N"" for Nerder"" he sets out to solve who was involved in his demise. When Nelson finds out Martin is alive, he punches him, but says that he is glad he is not dead. In ""Grade School Confidential"", Martin invites Nelson to his birthday party. When he places the invitation on Nelson's desk, Nelson pushes it off and gives him a rejecting sigh. Martin puts the invitation back on his desk, only for him to shove it off again.
 The trio show almost absolutely no friendship towards Martin. They are often seen inflicting many painful and embarrassing acts of bullying on him, like stringing him up the flagpole by his underwear. In The Simpsons Movie, Martin is seen getting a flagpole wedgie by Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. In ""Any Given Sundance"", when they needed to make sound effects for a video Lisa was making that involved Marge pounding meat, they made the sound by having Jimbo and Dolph hold Martin's arms while Kearney punches him. Once Martin pleaded Lisa to have them turn to the next scene, it was just Marge pounding a different type of meat, much to Martin's disappointment. Once the three bullies were trying to train Marge to be an MMA fighter in ""The Great Wife Hope"", they told Marge to punch a punching bag that had a struggling Martin tied up inside of it. According to Martin, they put him in there because he looked them in the eye when he gave them his lunch money. Although the 3 inflict various acts of bullying on him, he appears to be quite friendly with them. For example, in ""Barting Over"", when he gets a tattoo of a unicorn on his cheek from a tattoo parlor (which he thought was a paint dispenser), he goes up to them and shows it off. When they inform him that it was a tattoo parlor, he passes out. The bullies hesitate beating him up, thinking that he's ""suffered enough"", but then beat him anyway. When Martin offers to share his box of cookies from the bakery with someone who has a knife that can cut the ribbon that keeps the box closed in ""Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood"", Jimbo and Kearney willing cut the ribbon for him. Martin thanks them and says, ""Now let's all share the goodness"". Kearney then says ""Share this!"" before swiping the cookies from Martin and pushing him into a mud puddle, leaving him humiliated. In ""Bye Bye Nerdie"", the three of them, along with Nelson, are seen throwing tomatoes at him while he is hanging from the bleachers by his feet. In the movie, when he along with everyone else thinks their end is coming by the bomb, he walks up to them and shouts out ""I've been taking your crap all my life!"" and he beats them up with a 2 by 4 wooden stick saying it was fun and then he continues to beat them up. In ""The D'ohcial Network"", Jimbo ties him to a tree for trying to explain the word conundrum and then Jimbo and Bart throw punches at him.
 An older Martin. He attended Springfield High School and went to the prom with a robot. He most likely went to college and then returned to Springfield Elementary and became a teacher. There was a science fair explosion at Springfield Elementary. He was thought to have been killed, but he survived, although he admits that on a few days, he did wish that he had died on that day. He lived the rest of his life like the Phantom of the Opera under the school, playing music on an electric pipe organ. He also is one of the many people to donate their digestive tract to Bart. 
 While non-canon in nature, Martin's future date to the prom turns out to be a robot.
 In ""Barthood"", he attends Milhouse's graduation party where he talked to Ralph Wiggum.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", it is implied that the character has transitioned to female, now going by Marcia Princess. 
 ""You got greedy, Martin."" Prior to the events of The Simpsons Game, Martin was at a Band Concert and Wiseguy went to see it. Wiseguy went to Martin to tell him that he heard him and his French Horn was way out of tune, Martin explains that he tuned it in a cold room at the School Auditorium it was Surprisingly warm and James Horner was in the audience puking. Martin says he could set thing right my refunding the ticket price wish was three dollars but Wiseguy said three dollars won't payback for the time he lost and said to repay him buy tuning his instrument like A Dam Professional.
 Prior to The Simpsons Game Martin sold Band Candy to Lou. Lou later when up to Martin and said he bought a crunch bar and it was Almond inside Martin said Almonds are crunchy, Lou said that crunch on a candy bar usually means Rice or something Marin says usually but not always and if there is anything else Lou replies with No and Calls Martin a jerk.
 Then Martin gets Grand Theft Scratchy and hijacks Ned's car and later crashes it and fights Lisa and Marge.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror IV"", Martin can be seen as a vampire in the final segment.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror V"", Martin can be seen in a cage waiting to be eaten.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror VI"", when the students take a test Martin finishes early, falls asleep and is killed by Willie in his nightmare. But in reality, Martin dies in class, with his face and body frozen in a look of absolute horror.
 In the second segment ""Treehouse of Horror VII"", he loses to Bart in the science fair.
 In the second segment of ""Treehouse of Horror X"", he is seen at Springfield Elementary School gym getting his candy inspected.
 In the first segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XXX"", he is playing E.T. with Bart, Milhouse and Nelson.
 In the final segment of ""Treehouse of Horror XXXI"", he is seen at Lisa's ninth birthday party.

Dr. J. Loren Pryor,True,False,False,False,False,1,Shearer,105,"Dr. James Loren Pryor, M.D. is the psychologist for the school district in which Springfield Elementary School is located.
 Dr. Pryor is one of the few employees at Springfield Elementary School who seems to actually be qualified in his field, despite relying on long outdated psychological methods such as using calipers on children's heads to conduct a phrenology analysis of children's mental status; phrenology was discredited in the scientific community by the 1840s. He does have a slight tendency toward gullibility, as Bart easily tricked Pryor into sending him to a school for gifted children by. Later, however, Pryor recommended that Bart repeat the fourth grade and refused to back off of his recommendation, in spite of Bart's protests.
 Dr. Pryor also seems to be prone to occasional absent-mindedness. When Bart was in kindergarten, Homer and Marge saw him to discuss problems Bart was having with adjusting to school. Pryor said it was due to Bart's ""flamboyantly homosexual tendencies,"" and then corrected himself when he realized he was looking at Milhouse's file instead of Bart's.
 Pryor has had a much more uniformly positive influence on Lisa. On the same visit as when he accidentally disclosed the contents of Milhouse's file, Pryor spotted Lisa as a gifted child when she did a complicated puzzle and gave her age as ""Three and three-eighths."" He told Homer and Marge to nurture her gift. Later, when Lisa went through a rebellious phase, Pryor determined that it was the result of a developmental condition and correctly advised Homer about how to help her through it.
 He took part of the world's tallest human pyramid record attempt.
 After a several-year absence from the show, Pryor reappears, giving Bart some counseling over his coping of Marge's gray hair after Bart beat up Milhouse on the playground following comments made by Milhouse regarding Marge's hair.
 Pryor appears once again in the episode ""Mothers and Other Strangers"" after another several years of absence. In a flashback as a guidance counselor, he tried to help a teenage Homer move on from the loss of his mother Mona (although she's still alive) by recommending to him to join the army but Homer declines and walks out of the room.
 When Bart's and Lisa's arrangement to prank each other's teachers goes severely wrong, Lisa decides she has to kill Bart and chases him through Springfield Elementary School with a knife. At one point during the chase, Bart ducks into Dr. Pryor's office.
 Pryor was on the top balcony of the Parasite house being strangled by Dolph. But it's not known if he was killed by him or not.

Radioactive Man,,False,False,False,False,1,,106,"""Radioactive Man"" is the second episode of Season 7 (originally was going to be for Season 6 in production order).  This was also the first episode in the series to use digital animation.
 A movie based on comic book character Radioactive Man is filmed in Springfield. Much to Bart's chagrin, the coveted part of the hero's sidekick, Fallout Boy, goes to not him, but to his best friend Milhouse, who immediately hates the idea of being a movie star. 
 
Bart and Milhouse are thrilled to hear that a film version of their favorite comic book, Radioactive Man, is coming soon. Rainier Wolfcastle, the star of the McBain films, is chosen to play Radioactive Man, and even more excitingly for the Springfield Elementary School children, the production moves to their town after seeing a small poorly spelled advertisement in Variety Magazine. A search is launched for a young actor to play Radioactive Man's sidekick Fallout Boy, and Bart auditions. Bart does well, but is rejected because he is an inch too short. Bart leaves and tries to grow the extra inch before tomorrow and tries different methods.  When none of those ideas work, he acquires platform shoes and a vertical stripe suit (among other attempts to look taller), but by this point, Milhouse has already taken the part, albeit reluctantly, and his parents forced Milhouse to be an actor. Kirk and Luann immediately begin purchasing expensive objects when Milhouse becomes an actor.   Bart is told by Lisa that he is still needed as a star's friend and confidant, and Bart eagerly accepts this new role. However, Milhouse finds his own job intolerable as he has to get up early for hair and makeup, he also has to reshoot several scenes again despite doing it.  Eventually Milhouse becomes fed up and disappears during the filming of the most expensive scene in the movie. The film is suspended while the townspeople search for Milhouse, at first one of the film workers tries to edit in previous shot scenes with Milhouse to the Final Cut but they make no sense and he is fired. Eventually, Bart finds him in the treehouse. Bart tells Milhouse that he will be a hero, but Milhouse retorts that the real heroes are the people fighting heart disease and global hunger.
 Bart scoffs at this, saying that those 'pitiful loser' real heroes aren't winning their fights, and to find heroes that actually accomplish something, you have to turn to show business. Despite this and encouragement from former child star Mickey Rooney, Milhouse gives up on his acting career. Mickey tried to take over as the new Fallout Boy, but all production on the film is aborted, with Milhouse refusing to play Fallout Boy and the project going bankrupt thanks to price gouging and other unscrupulous conduct by the people of Springfield (i.e. Mayor Joe Quimby inventing new taxes on the fly to take every red cent they have). Due to the town's misbehavior, the film would never come into fruition. Mickey scolds them for doing this. However, Mayor Quimby and the others refuse to give any of the money back. The directors then return to Hollywood, ""where people treat each other right.""
 Rainier Wolfcastle says: ""My eyes! The goggles do nothing!"" The episode was written by John Swartzwelder, and directed by Susie Dietter. Dietter was not a comic book fan, so she got most of her inspiration for the episode from Batman: The Animated Series.
 ""Radioactive Man"" is the first episode of The Simpsons to be digitally colored. The task went to USAnimation, who would later animate ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"". Digital coloring would not be attempted again until Season 12's ""Tennis the Menace"", and again in Season 14's ""The Great Louse Detective"" when the show permanently switched to digital coloring.
 The episode finished 51st in the ratings. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.5. It received positive reviews from critics. The authors of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide said it reminded them of Tim Burton's ""Batman"" films, and that Milhouse was the perfect choice to play Fallout Boy.

Rabbi Hyman Krustofski,True,False,False,False,False,3,stars,107,"Dan Castellaneta Ghost form. Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky was Krusty the Clown's Jewish father.
 Hyman Krustofsky was born to Zev Krustofsky, who had immigrated to the United States in 1902. Hyman was a respected Rabbi in Springfield's Lower East Side; his father and grandfather also having been rabbis. He was married to a woman named Rachel, and the marriage produced one son, Herschel Krustofsky. Rachel died prior to Herschel's adolescence, and Hyman had guided Herschel into following his footsteps. Herschel, however, thought of being a clown, which angered Hyman as he believed life was too serious for such antics. Herschel secretly worked on comedy acts, and got his first laugh at the yeshiva school doing an impersonation of his father. Hyman found out about this and worked to discourage his son. Herschel got a gig performing antics for a rabbi's convention, where Hyman was in attendance. When a jocose rabbi pulled a prank on Herschel by spraying him with seltzer, this washed off the clown makeup. An angered Hyman disinherited Herschel.
 Years later, Bart Simpson and Lisa Simpson found out about the estrangement between Hyman and Herschel (now better known as Krusty the Clown) and waged a campaign to convince Hyman to reunite with his son by quoting passages of Jewish scripture. After several attempts, Bart finally convinced Hyman by quoting Sammy Davis Jr.. Hyman met his son backstage on The Krusty the Clown Show, and the two embraced after many years. Hyman Krustofsky appeared in front of the audience playfully throwing a pie at Krusty.
 In a later, nonspeaking appearance, Homer appealed to Rabbi Krustofsky to pay for a quadruple bypass surgery. Typical to Homer's ineptitude, he claims to be Jewish and his claim to doing so is by wanting to see ""Fiddler on the Roof"". Krustofsky looks surprised when Homer out of the blue asks for $40,000, and it is implied that he was refused, although the rabbi did give him a dreidel, which Homer is later playing with.
 Hyman with His son Krusty In ""Today, I Am a Clown,"" when Krusty and Bart and Lisa Simpson go to Rabbi Krustofsky to ask why Krusty never had a Bar Mitzvah when he was thirteen, Krusty's father explains it was because he was afraid that Krusty, being very mischievous as a kid, would make a mockery of the whole ceremony. Homer Simpson was given a show during Krusty's time-slot on Saturdays (the Sabbath day for Jews) and it was so popular that Krusty's show was cancelled. In a move of desperation, he decided to televise his Bar Mitzvah. It proved to be extremely successful, but disappoints Hyman. Krusty, feeling guilty, tells his dad after the show that he wants to have a real Bar Mitzvah the traditional way at a Jewish temple, which pleases Rabbi Krustofsky. The two have a much simpler manhood ceremony. Rabbi Krustofsky later teamed up with his son for the series Keeping Up with the Krustofskys. He died during the first episode of Season 26, ""Clown in the Dumps.""
 Jackie Mason voiced the character in ""Like Father, Like Clown,"" ""Today, I Am a Clown"", ""Once Upon a Time in Springfield"" ""Treehouse of Horror XXII"", ""The Ten-Per-Cent Solution"", ""At Long Last Leave"", ""Clown in the Dumps"", ""The Nightmare After Krustmas"", ""Fears of a Clown"", ""Flanders' Ladder"", ""Woo-hoo Dunnit?"", and ""When Nelson Met Lisa"". All other appearances are voiced by Dan Castellaneta.
 Mason won an Emmy Award for his performance in ""Like Father, Like Clown.""
 The episode ""Like Father, Like Clown"" was intended to spoof the film The Jazz Singer, but it also made reference to Jackie Mason, whose father was a rabbi. Mason broke with the family tradition to pursue a career in comedy, however he did undergo rabbinical training in the event his comedian's career did not pan out, he could fall back on a job as a rabbi.

Lois Pennycandy,False,False,False,False,False,3,Hayden,108,"She swayed Krusty into visiting Bart, who saved Krusty from jail time and later reunited him with his estranged father, the Rabbi Hyman Krustofski. She was at Krusty's side during the auditions where Robert Terwilliger became Krusty's new sideshow, and was at Krusty's ""funeral"" when Krusty was presumed dead after crashing his private jet into a cliff. In a phone conversation with Marge, Marge asked her, ""How can  hurt someone who loves him so?"" Pennycandy replied, ""Oh, Mrs. Simpson, I've wasted my womanhood asking that same question"", while looking at a framed photo of Krusty the Clown.
 She did show an aggressive side when answering an angry letter from Bart in response for the constant rebuffments. She forced Krusty to read the letter, but remembering Krusty was illiterate, she surmised it as ""the boy who never lost faith in you has lost faith in you!"" She demanded Krusty have dinner with the Simpsons that evening or else she would resign immediately.
 At a charity bachelor auction for the Springfield Fire Department, she combined her bid with four other women to share the same bachelor.
 Pennycandy's only speaking roles are in ""Like Father, Like Clown"", ""Krusty Gets Kancelled"" and ""Homie the Clown"", and she is voiced by Pamela Hayden. She made her most recent episodic appearance in ""G.I. (Annoyed Grunt)"", dressing Krusty in an anti-PETA fur coat, per his request.
 She might be based on Miss Moneypenny from the James Bond movies. Both characters are secretaries attracted to their employers. Their last names are very similar, and also Pennycandy's first name may come from Moneypenny's first actress, Lois Maxwell.

Mr. Teeny,True,False,False,False,True,3,Castellaneta,109,"
Louis 'Mr. Teeny' Toot, also known as Joseph Teeny, and known to his mother as Louise, is Krusty the Clown’s chain-smoking trained chimp.
 Like Krusty, he is a heavy smoker (usually cigars, but sometimes cigarettes) and often seems depressed off-stage. He was once seen playing Wii Sports with Krusty. He is sometimes seen as Krusty’s chauffeur,  accountant, comedy writer, and butler. He's a classic act in Krusty´s show when he does ""monkey business"". Mr. Teeny also rescues Krusty from a bomb carried by a brainwashed Bart.
 Krusty refers to Mr. Teeny as a monkey, although his lack of a tail indicates that he is a chimpanzee.
 Mr. Teeny is originally from Brazil. His uncle was once the head primate at the Bureau of Tourism in Brazil and his mother's name is Toot-Toot, and she calls him Louis when they're reunited.
 Also, it's revealed there have been other apes that went by the name ""Mr. Teeny."" Krusty apparently considers the third ""Mr. Teeny"" to be the best, and claims the current one and the very first one ""couldn't hold a candle"" to Mr. Teeny III--however, Krusty seemed to like Mr. Teeny II, at least in that Krusty claims that he helped him to score with women. Krusty once called the current Mr. Teeny in his possession is the seventh one to go by ""Mr. Teeny.""
 Teeny was a writer for the “Good Guy Awards” and quit after being insulted on-stage by Krusty.
 He is an immigrant from Brazil and was deported when Krusty went broke, but has since returned.
 In ""Coming to Homerica"" while playing chess with Mr. Teeny, Krusty said that ""you fell for my trap just like in Africa"" hinting he was born in (or at least lived in) Africa.
 Since there has been more than one Mr. Teeny some of them may have come from Africa while others came from South America. As he appears to be a simian, lacking a tail, his distant ancestors would have been African, even if his parents aren't, meaning his parents must be an invasive species, as non-human simians aren't indigenous to South America.
 He wears a pink fez and bow tie but has also been seen in a tuxedo and gold encrusted thong.
 Krusty has implied that if he can't find a human willing to donate a lung when he gets cancer, he's planning on harvesting one from Mr. Teeny (it may not be a very good lung since Mr. Teeny is a chain smoker).
 He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, except for in ""Dog of Death"" where Frank Welker voiced him. Captions are sometimes added when he speaks.

Portrayed by
Dan CastellanetaJens Jacob Tychsen (Denmark)


 Sir Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky, also once known under the alias of Rory B. Bellows, better known by his stage name Krusty the Clown (sometines spelled as: Krusty the Klown), is the cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoking clown host of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie's favorite TV show The Krusty the Clown Show. He is a recurring character in The Simpsons and has a supporting role in The Simpsons Movie.
 Krusty has Jewish parents and lived with his father in the Jewish community on Springfield's Lower East Side. As a rabbi, his father heavily criticized his son's career choice as a comedian. Keeping his entertainment lifestyle a secret, Krusty continued his role as a comedian until the day when his father came to one of his shows and a rowdy rabbi sprayed the makeup off his face in the Catskills. After this event, his father stopped talking to him, and they didn't make contact until many years later with Bart and Lisa Simpson. Although ethnically Jewish, he generally doesn't want to stress this heritage, to the extent that he prohibited any references to his Jewish background on his show up until his bar mitzvah.
 Krusty, without his makeup, bears an uncanny physical resemblance to Homer Simpson. However, there are also differences such as his cow-skull birthmark and small feet. Krusty had a near-fatal heart attack in 1986, requiring the installation of a pacemaker.
 He also seems to be disturbed at even the mere mention of someone having an affair, as when Homer tells Krusty the Clown that Apu was cheating on Manjula (due to his thinking he would joke about it), he reacted quite differently from how Homer expected by saying in a remorseful tone that it was sad and feeling sorry for all of their kids. Krusty lives in his mansion in the upscale residential area of Springfield Heights, which is also home to mob don Fat Tony and actor Troy McClure.
 Young Krusty as an entertainer When he was young, Krusty was similar to what Homer was like when he enrolled into clown school, showing an intense desire to become a showman and a stage performer when he grew up, estranging the relationship between his father to follow this dream. Like Homer, the decades of repeated humiliation, embarrassment, and dejection from the audience he entertained, jades Krusty's enthusiasm over his career until it turned him into a complete charlatan. Off-stage, Krusty has shown to be a skirt-chasing, manic-depressive, alcoholic, chain-smoking gambler which he states he became to deal with the stress of his job. He inhales moon rocks just to get him to ""normal"" and once became addicted to Percadon (ironically the sponsor of his show at the time). Krusty's cynicism has shown him to be a good comedian at times due to his way of seeing things as they are and most of his adult-orientated humor is uncouth for his role as a kids television presenter but his sellout tendencies, difficulty in taking matters seriously and enjoyment of his fame keeps him in a job he really hates. Once, he attempted standup, and even succeeded when he gave his cynical impressions, but his success ended up ruined when he tried to market the Canyonero.
 Despite his image as a children's role model, Krusty is very inappropriate when it comes to women. In Like Father, Like Clown, his favorite hotline is called ""Sex Chat"". He also faced a sexual harassment lawsuit which landed him a court-order sidekick Ms. No Means No, wrote a book called Sex and is also had a history of being addicted to pornography.
 Krusty using a hundred dollar bill to light a cigarette Krusty, throughout his career as a comedian, sold out and totally over-merchandised his name from his own fast food restaurant chain to toys, clocks, swabs, eye-dabbers, a clown school, Canyanero and Vodka rather than work on his own act. It is implied that his over-merchandising was in a failed attempt at curbing his gambling addiction. Because of his tendency to sell-out, he often steals from other comedians, once having to pay a settlement of $10,000 out of court for George Carlin for stealing his ""Seven Words You Can't Say On TV"" skit, and also to Steve Martin due to his use of ""Well, EXCUUUUUUUSE me!"", ironically during his phone call to George Carlin seconds earlier. His gambling issues have got him into trouble with the mafia and close to bankruptcy and he has literally burnt money to light a cigarette (and also implied while doing the act that such was even better than lighting the cigarette itself), once with a hundred dollar bill, a rare comic book and diamond pearls. Once, he left a live show and his audience waiting so he and Mel could see if their lottery tickets were winners and regularly gambles on sporting events.
 One of his most notable traits would be his deep dislike for his fans. For him, speaking to the audience at his live show is ""death"" and he almost never signs his own autographs, once having Bart, who was his assistant at the time, sign his own name for a crowd of fans, another time being Cletus' children and the one time he did sign an autograph himself, signed it ""K the C"" (which he justified by saying the pen he was using needed to last him all day). Ironically, the one fan who interacts with Krusty the most, Bart Simpson, who also saved him from jail, reunited him with his estranged father and helped him when his career was going nowhere, Krusty shows as much apathy for him as he does the rest of his fans, initially refusing to join Bart's family for dinner and even forgetting who he is without a reminder. He also has an unbridled hatred for his supervisors, Fox Television and interns. However, he has a notably closer relationship with Sideshow Bob and Sideshow Mel.
 Krusty with his father. Krusty's father is Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky (who passed away in the first episode of Season 26 called Clown In The Dumps), and his grandfather was Rabbi Zev Krustofsky. He also has an unnamed sister and a nephew named Josh. Through his mother, Rachel, Krusty is supposedly an older half-brother to the actor Luke Perry. He has several illegitimate children, which includes a son whose name is not mentioned and a daughter named Sophie.
 Krusty is known to be best friends with Sideshow Mel, but Mel is really just Krusty's sidekick. Krusty's real best friend is known to be Mr. Teeny, his helper monkey. He is also often shown to be friends with Sideshow Bob when he is out of jail even if Bob is merely trying to assassinate him. He also shares a relationship with Bart, who is his biggest fan and calls him his hero. While Krusty is fond of Bart and will often help him when he can, he often forgets about Bart and requires his memory to be coaxed, despite Bart saving him on several occasions. Often, Krusty just calls him ""kid"" rather than his real name.
 Krusty and his daughter Sophie Krusty has been married fifteen times. He usually gets married to his sideshows. He rejected Princess Penelope at their wedding believing that she deserved to marry someone better than him, but he eventually got back together with her. Krusty also had a child with a housemaid that said she was infertile. Krusty had a child named Sophie from a one-night stand with a female soldier named Erin.
 Despite his wealth, Krusty is frequently depressed when offstage. The contrast between these two personae is often used as a source of comedy by the writers. Krusty also exhibits laziness, irresponsibility, and promiscuity, among other negative traits. He smokes heavily and appears to have a low standard of health. He also has a laughing problem; he can randomly laugh at moments.
 Krusty is shown to be completely illiterate in ""Krusty Gets Busted"", and seems to be learning how to read in ""Like Father, Like Clown""; it seems Krusty is completely literate by the events of episodes such as Lisa's First Word and ""I Love Lisa"", as he reads things in these episodes.
 Krusty revealed that he was illiterate during a court case after being framed for armed robbery by Sideshow Bob. It is also revealed in ""Pulpit Friction"" he has vodka in his squirt flower and uses a monkey taser to train Mr. Teeny. He once committed tax fraud by placing some of his money in a secret account on the Cayman Islands. When he was accidentally exposed for it by Bart, he nearly lost everything. He deeply considered hitting Bart at the latter's request when he attempted to apologize, but chose against it, simply telling him to go home instead.
 Krusty about to hit Bart His illegitimate daughter, Sophie, was the result of Krusty sleeping with a female soldier during the Gulf War. Now estranged, her mother has developed a bitter hatred of clowns and displays it with her choice of artwork (depicting violence being performed against clowns), this being because his actions caused her to fail in her mission. Krusty also implied when meeting Sophie and learning that she was the byproduct of a one-night stand during the Iraq War that, besides Sophie's mother, he also slept with an Israeli flight attendant as well as Cokie Roberts during the Iraq War. Krusty is said to have married fifteen different wives, with each wife leaving him. He also was implied to have received fellatio from Susan Anton, as when asking for ""the animal that bites on  groin"" so he could compete with Angry Dad in terms of comedy, his secretary mistakes the request as being for Susan Anton before he specifies he meant a lemur when he said ""animal"". At one point he tried to pick up a girl at some point until he discovered that the chick was actually male, in which the morning after, he tries to get a friend to get him out of the relationship. At one point, he also proceeded to visit people who were undergoing medical surgeries and comfort them for reasons strongly implied to be due being sentenced in court to do so (his movements and sounds imply he had been sentenced due to a drunken hit and run ).
 Outside of personal problems, he has also shown himself to have medical problems. As noted above, he once suffered a heart attack on the air. He was also implied to have had heart surgery from another relapse during the time New Springfield was being blacked out by Old Springfield. He also mentioned that he was diabetic once to his daughter. He also has several organ problems, causing him to get worried when everyone decided to remove their organ donor stickers upon Bart's point after getting a driver's license at an early age due to saving Springfield from a fire. He also has a serious smoking addiction, to the extent that he had one nicotine patch on his arm, and eventually tried to lick it off, resulting in him having to cover himself. One time, he also ended up while trying to do a wind up collar gag in a park sketch involving Sideshow Mel, or rather, Sideshow Melanie, only for it to horribly backfire where the wind up collar ended up tying up his collar so much that it started to suffocate him due to it prematurely getting to 100 rpm (as he intended to start off at 60 rpm and reach 100 with the skirt blow) and eventually forced him to yank it off to avoid suffocating to death, and then proceeded to throttle the technician responsible for the device upon telling him off as well as the technician's poor choice of words when explaining why he had it at 100 rpm, and then (according to Lisa) firing the associate producer.
 Krusty (left) and Homer (right). The mob can't recognize Who is Krusty because of the similarity Krusty the Clown has aqua-green hair in three tufts on the sides and top of his head, as well as a white face (which was once revealed without makeup in ""Krusty Gets Busted""). He also wears a light purple, short-sleeved shirt and lime green clown pants with red clown shoes, a light blue bow-tie, and white gloves.
 He has the same face, and body and shape as Homer, which was frequently made light of in earlier episodes. When he was in court, he had his clown clothes removed to wear a prison uniform, his makeup was cleaned off, and his fake red nose was off, which reveals that he has the same face as Homer, except for his teal haircut. In later episodes, however, it is heavily implied that his ""makeup"" was actually pale skin that was created as a result of his heart attack.
 While Krusty said he was in the entertainment business for 50 years, he also claimed to have been estranged from his father for 25 years. Krusty's ""humble beginnings"" in his show-biz career was as a street-mime in Tupelo, Mississippi. According to one episode, he was banned for 10 years after saying the word ""pants"" in his TV debut in a 1957 episode of The Milk of Magnesia Summer Cavalcade, and returned in a Laugh-In episode where his shutters failed to open, which set him back ""another 22 years"". However, depending on various contradicting sources, he was a serious talk show host in 1961, a childish TV entertainer in 1963, or a cynical stand up act who moved to cheaper more physical gags in the mid-'60s after Annie Dubinsky became his agent. In 2011 Krusty also mentioned doing shows for kids before the 1970s. In any case, for much of his career, he had his own show, The Krusty the Clown Show.
 Krusty doing an act during the Gulf War In 1973, he performed a song of The Doors live on TV (""Break on Through (To the Other Side)""). He briefly took up stand-up comedy, and during the Gulf War, he tried to entertain the soldiers by making an off-color pun off of Saddam Hussein's name (""Saddam Hussein?! They should call him ""So Damn Insane!!"" Hahahaha!"" ""Hey, you're just fanning the flames of hatred!""), as well as having the Cincinnati Bengal Cheerleaders entertain the soldiers, which was controversial at best (""Hey, I can't watch this! I have a girlfriend at home!"" ""This is an insult to our Muslim hosts!""). However, the show was unexpectedly shut down due to a sandstorm, so he was forced to take refuge in a tent which coincidentally had a female soldier whom he later slept with. However, the night of passion quickly turned sour after he ruined her chance at assassinating Saddam Hussein (as well as destroying an entire shipment of Duff beer to the camp, due to his jumping on her and her bazooka's aim going awry as a result). As a result of the one-night stand, he became the father of Sophie.
 He has been the subject of controversy a few times. As has been mentioned, his act during the Gulf War was considered to be in bad taste. He has also been known to utilize other outdated, insensitive stereotypes. For instance, during a charity stand-up routine in the Springfield Amphitheater, he imitated a stereotypical Asian to the shock of the audience, and his television show featured a skit with stereotypical portrayals of the French, Jamaicans, and gay men (which he associated with San Francisco).
 The Simpsons - Krusty The Clown Theme Tune Krusty quickly became a multimillionaire – mostly by mass-marketing his name and image to a variety of suspect products and services. In the Simpsons' world, there is everything from Krusty alarm clocks, to Krusty dolls, Krusty eyewash, and Krusty's Clown College (which Homer attended), many of which are owned by Bart. The more dangerous ones include the Krusty home pregnancy test, which ""may cause birth defects"", Krusty's brand of bubble gum, which contains spider eggs (which they knew about) and hantavirus (which they didn't know about), and Krusty's brand of cereal, which in one episode has a boast on the box first for a jagged metal Krusty-O in each box, and then flesh-eating bacteria in each box. Krusty seems also to be involved with the chemical industry; in one scene a railway tank car of Krusty brand sulfuric acid is shown. In addition, he also had a brand of Mayonnaise that ultimately ended up recalled for presumably health concerns, shortly after Krusty claimed it was safe, an event that Krusty apparently was still sore about as he called it ""out of bounds"" and immediately ended the ""interview"" with a swarm of news reporters after a similarly disastrous incident involving a massively overweight man getting trapped in the H-2-Whoa slide at Mt. Splashmore.
 There is only one known lawsuit to date regarding these products- the time that Bart ate a jagged metal Krusty-O and had to have his appendix removed. However, it was suggested at the end of the episode that he would sue Krusty again after he ingested the flesh-eating bacteria that was put into the cereal (mostly to get back the $500 he spent to make Lisa feel better). At one time, he had his own brand of Pork Products. This might have led to his almost fatal on-the-air heart attack. He also has Kamp Krusty, which was a living hell for anybody who went there (it was later revealed that the only reason he signed off on the camp was that he had been bribed with ""a dump truck full of money"", and eventually regretted the decision). Krusty also operates his own television production company, Krustylu Productions (a pun on Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz's Desilu Productions). (A list of Krusty-related products is attached at the end of this page.)
 Each Krusty product comes with his own seal of approval which he is 'supposed' to give after testing the product himself. Unfortunately for everyone who dares to buy any of his merchandise, Krusty endorses absolutely anything suggested to him immediately, and quality stamps shoddy products without even looking at them half the time. It's gotten to the point Krusty had to open the Klown Kollege because there was nothing else left for him to endorse.
 His fame was also such that he was almost knighted by the Queen of England (the ceremony was interrupted with an urgent phone call that presumably notified him of the riot occurring at Kamp Krusty).
 In ""Krusty Gets Busted"", Sideshow Bob frames Krusty for armed robbery of the Kwik E Mart in retribution of abusing him and his brother Cecil on his show. Homer serves as a witness to this robbery and sees the robber and describes him. Krusty is later arrested and put on trial while Sideshow Bob steals his show. Lisa and Bart go to the scene of the crime, and go over the evidence clearing Krusty of any wrongdoing - First, Krusty has a pacemaker, which prohibits him from using the microwave because the magnetron will short it out, which didn't happen because Bob used it to cook a burrito. Second, Krusty is illiterate, and Bob stole the Springfield Review of Books during the robbery and he was reading it before he held up Apu. Finally, Krusty does not wear clown shoes on his day off and would not have felt it, and Homer stepped on Bob's foot in the security footage causing him to exclaim in pain. With the new evidence Sideshow Bob is imprisoned for robbery and he vows to kill Bart and Krusty when he gets out, Krusty is released on bail, while Bart and Lisa get all the Krusty products back.
 His show was canceled once after the debut of Gabbo, the ventriloquist dummy, who was so popular, Krusty was driven out of business. Bart managed to get the Gabbo show canceled in two ways: when he snuck into the studio and switched on the camera during what was supposed to be a commercial break, revealing ventriloquist Arthur Crandall saying ""All the children in Springfield are S.O.B.s"" through Gabbo, and helping Krusty with creating a comeback special for Krusty was ultimately held (Parody of the Elvis comeback special), in which Krusty's many Hollywood friends bailed him out.
 Krusty often retires from and then returns to showbiz throughout his career. One of his attempts was almost a permanent one because of recently paroled Sideshow Bob's latest scheme – wiring plastic explosives to a hypnotized Bart and sending him up on stage to kill Krusty. However, a last-minute change of heart at Krusty's touching mention of him in a speech waylaid Bob's plan (as well as a last-minute rescue by Krusty's chain-smoking chimp, Mr. Teeny).
 Krusty even faked his own death to avoid the IRS. Taking the name Rory B. Bellows, he became a salvager of sunken ships.
 In ""Lisa's Wedding"", he attends Lisa Simpson's wedding and Julius Hibbert tells him that Maggie Simpson has an incredible voice.
 In ""Future-Drama"", at age 60, he meets Marge Simpson after she and Homer separate. He beats up Homer after the latter challenges him to a fight. After the fight, Marge dumps Krusty and finally gets back together with Homer originally.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", Krusty is seen on a grown-up category saying boring things about his life at age 82, which Bart Simpson finds out when attempting to entertain his loveable (and sometimes disrespectful) kids.
 Krusty appears as the Headless Horseman in the opening of ""Treehouse of Horror VI"", throwing his head at the camera and making his trademark groan.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XIX"" segment ""How to Get Ahead in Dead-vertising,"" Krusty is the first celebrity harmed by Homer (albeit unintentionally) for a group of amoral ad men's purpose of using his likeness in commercials without having to pay royalties. Enraged, Krusty leads an army of celebrities from Heaven to take revenge on Homer and other Springfieldians, killing Homer with a shotgun blast to the head. When returning to heaven, they were locked out by Homer as revenge.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XX"" segment ""Don't Have a Cow, Mankind,"" Krusty was present at Krusty Burger for the unveiling of their new Burger², and explains the process of how it's made to Kent. Immediately after Kent becomes a ""muncher"", he bites Krusty in the arm, and while berating him for doing so, Krusty also transforms and confronts the cameraman.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XXIV"", Krusty has Lisa Simpson's head on him after her head gets sawed off her own body.
 Krusty is involved as one of the townspeople who is attempting to do a taxi service among members of the community in an attempt to buy back the public transit system from Mr. Burns after the latter converted it into a nuclear-powered bus system. He also announces the player's current rating system after the player completes the level or loses the level (although the voice who says the title itself was actually Harry Shearer, in a monotonous voice, dubbing over the obviously pre-recorded message.) He is also an unlockable character with his clown car. In one of the game's missions, he tries to get tourists away from his house by knocking over the signs leading to it.
 Krusty the Clown advertised and endorsed Buzz Cola shortly after it hit the market. However, most other times, he was frequently depressed, and also had some disbelief in regards to Bart attempting to warn the townsfolk about an impeding Alien conspiracy.
 Rather ironically, Krusty appears in the level Mob Rules as one of the people Marge can use to protest the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy videogame to minors. Mini-Krusties appear in Shadow of the Colossal Donut to attack Homer and Bart, spouting out various (and sometimes twisted) Krusty the Clown sound bites. Throughout the game Bart can collect Krusty coupons that he can use to win various Krusty-based trophies. The Mini-Krusties make a final appearance in the Game Over level as one of the icons God uses to defeat the Simpsons as the family destroy his ''Hii''.
 Krusty appears in the very last segment of this as one of the passengers on the maiden voyage of the S.S Neptune. He is among those killed when a tsunami capsizes the ship. He sits up with a pair of legs across him and exclaims angrily ""Hey you schmuck, get off of me!"", only to realize that it is his lower body as he has been cut in half. He laments going out ""with a side gag"" before dying.
 In the Simpsons/Family Guy crossover, Krusty can be seen at the trial next to Mort due to the fact they're both Jewish. He is later at the Krusty The Clown Show, blasting Peter out of a cannon while Peter and Homer are in combat.
 In The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood, Krusty is at his theme park where he announces his new ""Thrilltacular, Upsy-downsy, Spins-aroundsy, Teen-operated Thrill Ride."" and decides on which family will be the first to try it out. Eventually, he chooses Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and Grampa for the ride, unaware that it is part of a sinister plot by Sideshow Bob who is not only seeking revenge on the clown, but the Simpson family as well.
 Krusty's first appearance in the Simpsons short ""The Krusty the Clown Show"" The character of Krusty was partially inspired by real-life clown ""Rusty Nails"" whom Simpsons creator Matt Groening watched as a child while growing up in Portland, Oregon. Some of his biographical details echo those of comedian Jackie Mason, who voices Krusty's father, including being the son of an orthodox rabbi, and being temporarily banned from television due to a controversial performance.
 Krusty's appearance and design is basically just that of Homer Simpson with clown make-up. Groening said that ""The satirical concept that I was going for at the time was that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshiped a clown who looked exactly like his father,"" a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. The idea of Homer as Krusty, however, was revisited in Homie the Clown, where Homer takes a job as a Krusty double, only to get abducted by Fat Tony, who mistakes Homer for Krusty partly due to the resemblance.
 It has been stated by Groening that the voice of Krusty was based on the long-time Chicago version of Bozo played by Bob Bell.

Lenny Leonard,True,True,False,False,False,1,Castellaneta,112,"Lenford Landon ""Lenny"" Leonard (born April 13, 1957) is a recurring character in The Simpsons, and a supporting character in The Simpsons Movie. He is the best friend of Carl Carlson and, along with Carl, second best friend of Homer Simpson, behind Barney Gumble and Moe Syzslak. He works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and possesses a master's degree in nuclear physics, but he is portrayed as a simple, often naive, blue-collar working man. Lenny is also one of the few characters allowed to possess a ""Simpson's Family"" trait: Homer's beard line. He is also seen having extreme dandruff in some episodes.
 He also has a green elephant called Huffnpuffalaus as an imaginary friend who once slept with Stradivarius Cain's girlfriend, it is also a running gag that Lenny usually has several objects caught in his eye.
 Lenny and Carl fighting Despite being shown in the First Church of Springfield, Lenny is a Buddhist. Born in Chicago, he is also a war hero and a three-time juror. His grandmother spent 20 years in a Soviet labor camp, hinting that Lenny may have ancestors from the former Soviet Union, or have ancestors who were POWs. In The Simpsons comics number 116 we learn that Lenny is the last surviving descendant of the Woopakanomie Native American tribe. He was a member of the Springfield chapter of the Stonecutters secret society (Number 12, outranking Mr. Burns). Lenny seems to have little regard for his own life: ""Quick and pointless, that's the death for me"". Another example of his apathy towards salvation is that he shrugs after being pulled from a ladder which would have seen him and Homer to safety. In ""Mommie Beerest"", Lenny has a magazine cover from the week of his birth, the headline reads 'Bloodbath in Laos' this means his date birth is possibly in March of 1971, in that date Life magazine published on its cover photos of Laotian Civil War. 
 Lenny is left-handed. He also has a psychiatric disorder, for which he takes medication.
 Lenny works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant alongside Carl Carlson and Homer Simpson. Despite his steady job, Lenny has been featured with several other jobs. On one occasion, he is promoted to head of the power plant when Mr. Burns goes bankrupt; which Smithers later describes to Homer as a ""reign of terror"". Homer considers Lenny to be the second richest man he knows. However, Lenny is once shown living in a dilapidated house, and pleads with Marge to not tell anyone how he lives. By the time of ""Helter Shelter"", he has moved to a fancy, well-furnished modern apartment... that happens to share a wall with a jai-alai court. According to him, he finds the sound of the balls hitting the common wall 'soothing'.
 In ""Lisa's Wedding"", it's shown Lenny is once again in charge of the power plant. In one episode, it is implied he is an undercover agent whose target is Homer. He was also fired from the Nuclear Power Plant at least twice, once as a demonstration to Bart as how he should act as his heir, and the second due to being the last one in the designated cabin in a Company Competition. Also, during an Employee Appreciation Night, he attempted to thank Mr. Burns for the great evening, but his attempt backfired due to him being drunk, which only resulted in terrifying his employer.
 At the Adult Education Annex, Lenny teaches a class on ""How To Chew Tobacco"". In one of Homer's daydreams, it's shown that Lenny is President of the United States. In ""Homer vs. Dignity"", Homer says he is a war hero, implying Military Service.
 Lenny with his gun Lenny is a member of the Republican party, and possesses a Dole/Kemp '96 American flag tattoo. However, he seems to learn on the less extreme side of the political right, as he disliked the reactionary radicalism of Birch Barlow. Lenny is also a successful writer who wrote a series of mystery novels, one of them entitled ""The Murderer Did It"", which are called ""scary good fun"" by Stephen King. Lenny is also shown to be a member of the NRA as seen in ""The Cartridge Family"". His weapon of choice appears to be an AR-15 rifle with a vertical grip, which he says ""are manufactured for a reason: to take out today's modern super animals like the flying squirrel, and the electric eel."" 
 Lenny is an adept guitar player. According to the episode ""That '90s Show"", Lenny was a guitar player for his friend Homer's Grunge band, Sadgasm. The band split up some time after the release of their song ""Margerine"".
 Screw in Lenny's head Though only a lowly nonentity at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Lenny holds an exceptionally high ranking position at the local Stonecutters's Lodge -- 17 points above Mr. Burns, in fact. Due to his exalted status in this secret order, Lenny enjoys the gratifying privilege of squeezing Mr. Burns's nose whenever he feels like it, which he never does.
 Lenny has short, straight dark brown hair as well as the ""beard line"" present in only him and very few other characters. He wears a dark green shirt, visible purple suspenders, grey pants, and black shoes.
 A running gag throughout the series is that Lenny frequently hurts his eye, usually causing him to exclaim ""Ow, my eye! I'm not supposed to get  in it!"".
 In ""Flaming Moe's"", his head gets set on fire.
 In ""Homer at the Bat"", he gets hit in the knee by a baseball bat.
 In ""Last Exit to Springfield"", Homer punches him in the back of the head, causing him to spit out his coffee.
 In ""Monty Can't Buy Me Love"", he gets stabbed in the head by a coin.
 In ""G.I. D'oh"", he gets run over by a tank.
 In ""Bobby, It's Cold Outside"", he gets caught in a gunpowder explosion.
 Little is known about Lenny's family, although it is said that his mother loves both Carl and Moe better than him. She also states that she wishes Carl were her son. The feeling is mutual.
 He once stated that his father died in a war, but he doesn't know in which.
 Lenny has a sister that dates Carl only on Valentine's Day as seen in ""The Blue and the Gray"". Lenny mentioned in ""The Burns Cage"" that he was visiting her funeral.
 
Lenny's best friend is Carl Carlson, as they are rarely seen apart; his other friends are Homer, and regulars at Moe's including Barney Gumble and Moe Szyslak. On Lenny's birthday, his friends attempted to throw a surprise party for him at Moe's, which is ruined by Homer, who then sits on a cake shaped like Lenny's favorite bar stool. Homer repeatedly confuses Lenny and Carl, and is shocked  Lenny with drunks  to learn on one occasion that Lenny is white, and Carl is black. To guide himself, Homer has ""Lenny = White, Carl = Black"" on his hand. He once muttered to himself, ""Is that right?"" while reading it. Homer once exclaimed, ""That's Lenny? I wanted the black one!"". When Mr. Burns appears on a radio show in an attempt to boost his popularity, Homer tells him that he has a list of jokes explaining the differences between white and black people; Homer later stated, ""White guys have names like Lenny, whereas black guys have names like Carl.""
Lenny appears to be well liked by the Simpson family. On one occasion, Marge and the kids built a prayer shrine for him when learning he was taken to the hospital. When Homer went bowling but tells Marge that Lenny was hospitalized; Marge informs the kids, they respond the same way she did and shout, ""Not Lenny!""  The Simpson family had a cake inscribed ""Happy Labor Day Lenny"".   Marge has a picture of Lenny in her hair. In The Great Louse Detective, Lenny tells Sideshow Bob to kill Bart. It is also shown that Lenny greatly values all his friends when he throws them a lavish party (after winning on a lottery ticket) to celebrate their amity.
 The possibility of a sexual relationship between Lenny and Carl has constantly been alluded. When Marge's Popsicle stick sculptures of Lenny and Carl are destroyed and mashed together, Lenny stated, ""I don't know where Carl ends and I begin!"", to which Carl replies, ""See, it's statements like that that make people think we're gay.""
However, in one of the recent episodes, Carl and Lenny are seen to be holding hands when they are in a limo with Marge and Homer trying to cheer up Moe.
 When Lenny saw heaven, and Carl asked 'Hey, what does it look like?' we see hundreds of Carl- Angels saying 'get up Lenny, it's time for work'.
 
Carl once told Seymour Skinner that ""Marriage is gonna be great. Now you'll have someone who'll rub your back - without being asked"" while glaring at Lenny, who sighed ""Oh, not this again."" Carl then responds ""Yes, this again."" When Homer opened a chapel for gay couples after gay marriage was legalized, he speculated that Lenny and Carl might be interested, and Marge responds with ""Don't you push them - they've gotta work that out for themselves."" Once, Chief Wiggum remarked that Lenny's relationship with Carl is on the rocks. Two non-canon future family portraits from the 2006 couch-gag suggesting, that Lenny and Carl might be gay. While helping Lisa with a science project, Homer quoted to Lisa ""You and science go together like Lenny and Carl - the science is Carl"". Another time, Lenny and Carl saw Homer and Marge kiss, prompting Lenny to remark, ""Remember when we used to kiss like that, Carl... with our respective girlfriends?"" They then discuss what happened to them. Apparently one turned out to be a prostitute and one died. In the Simpsons Game, if the player fails to rescue Lenny and Carl in ""Lisa the Tree Hugger"", Carl might say, ""Tell Lenny... I loved... his recipe for caramel sundaes.""
 Lenny's hero worship over Carl has reached a mounting point. Lenny revealed that he carved Carl's face on a mountain, and called it Mount Carlmore. He later leaves a burning oil field, only because Carl arrived. On one occasion, the residents of Springfield see the stars, and see deep within their hearts and souls; Lenny sees Carl's face in the stars (Carl also sees himself there). Lenny published a newspaper called The Lenny-Saver with the headline: ""The Truth About Carl: He's Great."" After displaying this, he shed a tear and stated that ""it had to be told.""
Lenny and Carl were once pictured driving a sports car through the woods with two children in the back of contrasting background (either noting they are both single parents have separately or otherwise adopted children).
 Carl Carlson states that he and Lenny have the same mother when a major fire is closing in on her work. When Lisa brings back the stars, Lenny sees a constellation of Carl's face.
 Mount Carlmore It should be noted that all of these examples could just be for comedic purposes, as only their heterosexual exploits have been explicitly confirmed. One time Carl and him drunkenly suggest to Barney that he take them to the Playboy Mansion and the Girls College, respectively. In addition, Homer has mentioned that Carl and Lenny have mistresses they spend time with, and both Lenny and Carl were clearly aroused by the female stars of Lemony Lick-It's A Series of Horny Events when they accidentally stumbled upon the filming of the film and were also shown to be extremely willing to take up Homer's bribe of giving them roles to buy their silence to Marge, they're opting to be the foul-mouth boy and do the sex scenes with the girls, respectively. In addition, when Homer was describing a movie he saw that weekend regarding a buxom blonde (implied to be the same movie Mr. Burns held disgust over due to her being ""naked as a jaybird"" for half the film), Lenny, alongside Carl, acknowledged that it was ""their kind of film"" in bemusement, while also proceeding to oink (alluding to Mr. Burns' earlier claim of how the unwashed masses will ""oink for more"" regarding over-sized breasts and a happy end.).
 Lenny with drunks Lenny is apparently divorced - Carl says that he sang ""The Best Is Yet to Come"" at Lenny's wedding, although it was later shown that Lenny punched Carl for giving a bad speech at his wedding.
Lenny is a persistent bachelor who has poor luck with women. Lenny once shaved the legs of a woman who calls him an idiot for not shaving in an upward direction. Homer mentioned to Moe that both Lenny and Carl are with their mistresses. In yet another occasion, he was seen in the opening scene with his arm around a woman who appears to be his girlfriend.
It's revealed that he had dated a woman in a Woody Woodpecker outfit at a fairground for three months until she left him for the man who cleans the vomit on the roller coaster. Lenny had told Carl that he was married to a Beauty-Queen, but it is later revealed that Lenny made his Beauty-Queen wife up, and is unmarried.
 Doreen entering ""Moe's Tavern"".  It is mentioned once that Lenny dated a girl named Doreen, but decided to break up with her. He had no courage to do it, so he asked Homer to ""dump his girlfriend for him"". According to Moe, Doreen cheated on Lenny with everyone, except for him, even though Moe showered her with gifts.
 Lenny is also part of ""The Guys"".
 At age 47, Lenny owns a super pet. When Milhouse (with giant muscles) gets trapped between two trees, he and Carl leave him there. Shortly, afterwards Lenny gets married.
 When Lenny was 55, he was in charge of the nuclear plant. Some time after this, Lenny breaks up with his wife.
 By the time Lenny is 69, him and Carl have switched brains because Lenny wanted to get back together with his wife who was sleeping with Carl at the time, but she switched with a monkey on Japanese game show.
 Lenny and Carl are constant companions, and Bart had apparently paid the two to kiss one another. They then question whether they ever received the money from Bart for doing so, and upon realizing that they were never paid, both gain a worried expression.
 Lenny sits next to Glenn Quagmire and Quagmire asks Lenny if he likes sex to which Lenny replies ""Eh"" causing Quagmire to note that they are not very similar. 
 In Homer's dream in ""The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace"", Lenny is shown at Homer's funeral as president and when Homer wakes up, he asks Marge not to vote for Lenny.
 Dead Lenny in Treehouse of Horror XI In ""Treehouse of Horror XVI"", Lenny dies and sees the angels in Heaven take the form of Carl (although they're saying, ""Hurry up or we'll be late for work at the plant!""). 
 Lenny is killed by killer dolphins in the ""Treehouse of Horror XI"" segment ""The Night of the Dolphin"".
 In The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run Lenny appears in Level 1 mission, Office Spaced. Homer goes to a local Krusty Burger to ask Lenny where Mr. Smithers is. He can also later be found standing with Carl later in the level prior to the mission, The Fat and the Furious.
 In The Simpsons Game, Carl and Lenny are shown arguing while bird-watching, and having forgotten Lisa and Bart's names when they save Lenny and Carl from logging machinery, even though Lenny and Carl have known them all their lives. Later on both Lenny and Carl can be recruited by Marge in her mob to ban the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy game to minors.

Helen Lovejoy,False,False,False,True,False,1,MacNeille,113,"Helen Lovejoy going downstairs to the basement to seduce Timothy. Helen Lovejoy leading the Investorettes. Helen Lovejoy being a member of the Holy Rollers. The Lovejoy Family. Helen Lovejoy (née Schwartzbaum) is Reverend Timothy Lovejoy's judgmental and gossipy wife and the mother of Jessica Lovejoy. It is hinted that she is the godmother of Lisa and Bart Simpson. Though she can be rude at times, she is very kind to the people she loves and is almost always seen when we see the people of Springfield doing charity or community service. Helen can behave mean and gossipy and is part of a bowling team called The Holly Rollers with members Ned Flanders and Timothy Lovejoy Jr. and ex-member Maude Flanders (deceased) and (most likely) the leader of the Fleet-a-Pita club called the Investorettes with members Agnes Skinner, Luann Van Houten and ex-members Edna Krabappel (deceased), Maude Flanders (deceased) and Marge Simpson, whom the club kicked out in ""The Twisted World Of Marge Simpson"". Helen was often partnered with Maude Flanders as they protested against the ""evils"" in Springfield. Her first line was in ""Life on The Fast Lane"" and it was ""Marge? Marge Simpson. You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy the gossipy wife of the Minister."" Her catchphrase, ""Won't somebody please think of the children?"" is used quite often but sometimes, they replace the word ""children"" with a different word like in ""Thanksgiving of Horror"", she says ""The Pilgrims! Won't somebody please think of the Pilgrims?"". Also, in ""Pulpit Friction"", she says ""Why won't somebody blame the children?"".
 Helen's most prominent season is in Season 8, appearing and having a role in every single episode, most notably, ""The Twisted World Of Marge Simpson"". Maggie Roswell, her voice actress, did have a role in every single episode that season.
 Growing up in a little house on the prairie, where the only pastimes a young woman had were baling hay and fixing the hay baling machine, Helen fought off boredom by keeping herself up to date on the personal affairs of her neighbors. When a dashing young bible salesman from Springfield named Timothy Lovejoy showed up at her door, she found herself entranced by his Protestant good looks and his thrilling stories of the big city. By force of habit, Helen accidentally spread a rumor about herself and Timothy Lovejoy, and they were forced to marry. Thankfully, it was just what they wanted.
 In addition, Helen once attended a camp with Marge when she was 10. She was punished by having a fork stuck in her hand because she could not remember which out of 34 forks was an olive fork. It is hinted that she was punished in this manner many times. She used to sell cosmetics, but her husband asked her to quit because she was making more money than he was.
 Helen Lovejoy has large eyes with long lashes. She usually wears a pink sweater with a light blue shirt underneath that sticks out at her collar and makes a neat knot, a teal-colored long skirt and either plain black low-heeled shoes or shoes the same color as her skirt. She used to have brown hair, then changed it to red, and then, permanently gray. In some episodes her pink sweater is long-sleeved. In many winter episodes such as ""Wedding for Disaster"", it is revealed that during the winter, she wears a coat that is pink, long-sleeved and has a thick collar and also wears a necklace with something silver in the shape of a diamond. In ""Moe Letter Blues"" it is revealed that what she wears to bed is a light pink and purple gown and her brown cross necklace.
 Helen is the wife of Reverend Timothy Lovejoy and the mother of Jessica Lovejoy. She is a fair-weathered, judgmental, moralistic person and the typical town gossip. She thinks she can win by finding out secrets, and people joining her alliance so that she won't reveal their secrets. She introduces herself as ""the gossipy wife of the minister""; when she has nothing else to gossip about, she resorts to telling secrets about her own personal life. She is part of a group of local women known as the Springfield Investorettes, containing herself, Luann, Agnes and ex-members Marge, Maude and Edna, in which they sponsor and invest in companies and boxers.
 Her moral convictions look to always defend the interests of the minors, which explains her famous catchphrase, delivered in times of civic crisis (moral or otherwise): ""Will someone please think of the children?"". Often unaware that the kids of Springfield actually like most of the stuff she deems unsuitable.
 Helen is also openly conservative and was seen at the Republican Headquarters located at a haunting location.
 In ""Marge in Chains"", despite stating that she will use her gossip for good instead of evil, she continues to spread gossip at the expense of the Simpson Family throughout the series. In the episode ""The Frying Game"" she is in the court that decides over Homer and Marge's fates after supposedly killing a valuable insect. In ""The Fabulous Faker Boy"", Helen goes out of her way to give a backhanded compliment to Bart to spite Lisa, It's also implied she is a drinker when she 'rewards' herself for causing the Simpsons trouble by picking up a huge case of wine. She is particularly vindictive towards Marge.
 Although she is very religious and conservative, she is seen cheering when Seymour Skinner suggested that they should trade a giant check given to the school in a liquor store nearby, meaning she could be a hypocrite.
 Her closest friend was supposedly Maude Flanders and many think that is why she became more bitter after Season 11 when Maude passed on. This came in spite of the fact that her husband regarded the Flanders family to be annoying.
 Marge and Helen have a frenemy relationship. Helen is known to share gossip with Marge but spreads gossip about Marge as Helen is Lisa's godmother. This, however, is said during a Halloween special and is therefore considered non-canon, therefore it is unknown if this true. A possible reason why Marge dislikes Helen could be because Homer has said several times that he thinks that Helen is hot and attractive.
 Helen seen with pink hair Helen and Timothy have a stronger marriage than many other Springfieldians (save for Ned and Maude, and probably Dr. Hibbert). Many couples turned to divorce (Kirk and Luann Van Houten) or consistently argue, bear many kids, and have trouble with money (Cletus and Brandine Spuckler); however, Helen is somewhat patient of Timothy. Once Timothy spends more time on his own and slowly loses his mind, but Helen remains patient, however worried. In ""In Marge We Trust"" we see the bravery it took Helen, who doesn't like showing vulnerability, to be able to swallow her pride, push through the awkwardness and ask her greatest rival, Marge Simpson, for help about her husband's mental health. This shows just how much Helen loves her husband. Helen once mentions her mother is going to visit them and Timothy makes an insult saying that after Helen's father died, her mother visits them too much. However, once when her daughter, Jessica Lovejoy was running down the field to shoot a soccer goal. Helen yelled? ""Get it in, sweetie, and save our troubled marriage!""

 In Part 1, Reaper Madness, Homer Simpson wanted a better seat to the show so he killed people in front of him until he had the best seat. Unfortunately, Reverend Timothy Lovejoy Jr. is one of those people and we see Helen gasp in agony and reach down to mourn his death.
 In Part 2, Four Beheading and a Funeral, we actually see a close up of just Helen Lovejoy and her husband wearing a very old fashioned clothing style. We see them gasping when the Chief of police is about to pull the lever to hang ""The Muttonchop Murderer"".
 In Part 3, The Day the Earth Looked Stupid, Helen Lovejoy can be seen with her husband in practically every scene where there is panic over what to do about the ""aliens"".

 His origin is a bit mysterious as he says that he came into the United States in 1983. However, Ms. Pommelhorst claims that he defected into Germany, by ""cartwheeling over the Berlin Wall"".
 His harsh but effective training techniques helped Lisa to achieve a high standard of gymnastic ability. He also has a habit of confiscating his students' cats and dogs, only giving them back when the student has accomplished a physical task. Once however, he refused to give back a girl's dog, but gave her someone else's cat instead.
 He goes to anger management classes and threatens to spit on them.
 Apparently, he thinks Lisa (who is only eight), is a ""grandma"". This is probably a joke poking fun at the stereotype of European countries beginning to train potential future Olympic gymnasts at a very young age.

Lurleen Lumpkin,False,False,False,False,False,3,stars,115,"Lurleen Lumpkin is an attractive, aspiring country singer. Homer used to be her manager at one point.
 Lurleen is a talented, passionate, and attractive country musician. In her first appearance, she apparently wanted Homer to herself due to him being nice to her and being the guy who made her music dream come true. Despite that, she never really wanted to hurt Marge or the Simpsons family. She actually is a very polite, friendly, well-meaning lady.
 She apparently also has some daddy issues with her father Royce. He even abandons her again even after getting close to her again.
 She says she never went to school. Despite this, she is very intelligent.
 Lurleen has blonde hair in a ponytail with a blue headband while wearing a red country shirt with blue jeans with a white belt and pink/white boots. She also wears pink lipstick. In ""The Joy of Sect"", she has red hair.
 Homer discovered Lurleen in a bar in the middle of nowhere. She sang ""Your Wife Don't Understand You"" for the rowdy bar crowd, and Homer was amazed by her voice. He decided to help her launch a singing career, much to the chagrin of Marge.
 Lurleen was very grateful to have someone helping her with her career, but she quickly started falling for Homer, and it came out in her song lyrics.
 First, she flirted with him in ""Bagged Me a Homer,"" which angered Marge, but to which Homer remained oblivious. Then she made an open attempt to seduce him with a seductive song called ""Bunk with Me Tonight.""
 When Lurleen sang the song for him, it finally dawned on Homer that Lurleen was attracted to him. Later he had another epiphany. He said all he wanted to do was get people to be able to hear her singing, not commit adultery. He abruptly sold her contract to Rebel Yell Records, then returned home.
 Saddened but wiser, Lurleen then sang on the show a new song called ""Stand By Your Manager,"" which she had written on the spot. Happily, Homer and Marge were able to make up before the show was over.
 Lurleen enjoyed a brief period of success after Homer quit managing her. At what Kent Brockman described as the peak of her career, she appeared as a celebrity guest on The Muppet Show.
 Lurleen sang ""Bunk with Me Tonight"" for Kermit the Frog, which got him into trouble with Miss Piggy.
 After that, however, her career went into a downward spiral, and she started drinking heavily.
 She also never got over Homer, marrying and divorcing three times—with all of her ex-husbands, despite being from diverse ethnic backgrounds, bearing striking resemblances to Homer.
 Lurleen was present during the opening of the Springfield Monorail, where she revealed to Kent Brockman that she had been to the Betty Ford Clinic and had ""spent last night in a ditch.""
 Lurleen was also seen at the Bowlarama as one-fourth of a bowling team called ""The Home Wreckers,"" the other three members being Jacques Brunswick, Mindy Simmons, and Princess Kashmir.
 Lurleen resurfaced when Mayor Quimby was aggressively rounding up citizens who owed back taxes and was arrested. She pleaded to Judge Snyder that she couldn't afford to pay anything because all of her money was going to her ex-husbands, but Snyder was unmoved and ordered her to start paying her taxes.
 Homer and Marge promised to help her get her career back on track, and Marge helped reunite Lurleen with her deadbeat father.
 When her father betrayed her again (stealing one of her new songs), Lurleen retook control of her career and went on to open for the Dixie Chicks.
 She still didn't have all her personal issues resolved, though, as she fell for yet another man who resembled Homer.
 Lurleen Lumpkin in ""The Simpsons Road Rage"" In her debut appearance in ""Colonel Homer,"" Lurleen is voiced by American actress and singer Beverly D'Angelo, who reprises her role in the Season 19 episode ""Papa Don't Leech."" D'Angelo was cast because of her role as country music singer Patsy Cline in the film Coal Miner's Daughter. D'Angelo wrote the songs ""Your Wife Don't Understand You"" and ""Bagged Me a Homer."" In ""Marge vs. the Monorail,"" Lurleen is voiced by Doris Grau. Lurleen Lumpkin's alliterative name (L.L.) and her feisty style suggests she is based, at least in part, on Loretta Lynn. Lurleen was based at least in part on Kathi Kamen Goldmark, founder of the all-author band The Rock Bottom Remainders, whose members included Matt Groening.
 Note: All of her appearances are mostly brief background roles. The episodes in which she plays a major role are in bold.

Captain Horatio McCallister,True,True,False,False,False,4,Azaria,116,"Horatio Peter McCallister, more known simply as the Sea Captain, is a resident of Springfield. He is always seen holding a corncob pipe and squinting: because he has at least one glass eye - though once he was seen tapping both of his eyes and says he has ""two glass eyes."" In addition to eye(s), he also has an artificial leg. Owing to his occupation as a sea captain, he also spoke with a Bristolian accent. He was created by the writer Conan O'Brien.
 Though he admitted he isn't a real captain, Captain McCallister has (incompetently) piloted several vessels. On one occasion, he wrecks a cargo ship full of hot pants (although in that particular case, it wasn't actually his fault: The lighthouse's light had been destroyed by a desperate Homer and when he saw the lighthouse light turn back on, he attempted to correct his course); on another, in a reference to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, he causes an oil spill by crashing his tanker while drunk.
 He launches a river raft for Homer, only to have it sink immediately to the bottom. The captain's idea for Mr. Burns' casino involved three ships and fifty ""stout men"" who would ""sail 'round the Horn and return with the finest spices and silk"". On several occasions, he acknowledges his incompetence with a depressed, ""Arr, I don't know what I'm doin'."" Shortly before Mr. Burns blocked out the sun at 3:00 PM, he indicated that he had in fact seen the sun set once at that time while he was sailing in the arctic, but Mr. Burns interrupted him before proceeding to activate the Sun Blocker.
 At one time, he tried selling his houseboat to Marge and Homer while they were looking for a new home, and in an obvious nod to Robert Shaw's character in Jaws starts grappling with a shark when it attacks through the floor. He was apparently a Christian, as he had his ship blessed by Reverend Lovejoy until he learned at least three months later that Lovejoy's blessing the ship didn't count as a blessing since during the three months, his minister license was expired.
 In The Simpsons Comics 66- Crusin' For A Bruisin' we are introduced to his long-lost wife Tenille.
 In ""The Way We Weren't"" he mentioned that he was the sailing instructor at Camp See-A-Tree and on movie nights he runs the projector. He sails a young Homer across the lake to see a young Marge who is staying at Camp Land-A-Man. In the past he was slimmer and wore a jacket and jeans with a belt instead of a captain’s coat and boots. He also implied that he did plundering as a hobby, although he often was forced to give up his loot to pay his taxes on April 15, causing him to bitterly wonder why he even bothers doing that hobby at all.
 He lives on a houseboat on land as seen in 'Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky.
 As an entrepreneur, McCallister is equally incompetent. His restaurant, The Frying Dutchman, is a failing business venture that does not generate enough income to support its owner. He also once used Homer's bad review for his restaurant despite his hatred of it because it covers up the ""D"" from the health inspection agency nicely. The captain once appeared as a penniless bum.
When seeing Homer and Marge walking Homer's pet lobster at the beach, he approaches them and claims that he runs a ""small academy for lobsters."" However, when Marge refuses to send the lobster away to ""some snobby boarding school,"" McCallister asks her for spare change instead .
 He has never been shown with a girlfriend and, while it's generally believed that he's not gay, he has hinted at the fact that he has engaged in ""situational homosexuality"" with his fellow sailors. However, McCallister once took a picture of Patty and Selma in the nude, a picture which he claims to need for ""those lonely nights at sea"". He supposedly has at least one son, whom he describes as ""the catch of the day"" . In Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens and Gays, it’s implied that he was, at the time, in a relationship with Edna Krabappel, due to the positioning of the two characters whilst holding the ‘SSCCATAGAPP’ banner.

Ruth Powers,False,False,False,True,True,4,Roswell,117,"Ruth is divorced, and she has a daughter named Laura Powers. The circumstances behind Ruth's marriage are not explained, but she has mentioned her ex-husband behaves similar to a hardworking and career dedicated but less affable version of Homer Simpson and he was continually stiffing Ruth on child support. Due to his faults that were said to have led to their messy divorce, Ruth claims he stole her youth and outlook on life, which includes her becoming a near misandrist that she stole his car for revenge. 
 Ruth and Marge Simpson became fast friends after Ruth moved in next door. One evening, they went to a ballet after Homer, who was originally supposed to go with Marge, literally got stuck at work (with his arms in two vending machines). Later they had a girls' night out where they went line dancing at a country bar called Shotkickers, went raving at an underground club named The Hate Box, did some target shooting (using a farmer's antique cans as targets), and went up to the Springfield sign overlooking the city. They ended up going on the run from the law, however, after Chief Wiggum tried to pull them over because of a broken taillight, and Ruth chose to flee because they were driving the car which she had stolen from her ex-husband.
 Ruth is an active member of the NRA, having attended Homer's ""gun-warming"" party at the Simpsons house in ""The Cartridge Family.""
 Ruth had shown signs of being an alcoholic, since she is seen at an alcoholics anonymous meeting in The Simpsons Movie, as well as watching a video on the results of drunk driving with a horrified expression on her face in ""Duffless"". She was also at Moe's Tavern in New Kid on the Block when Moe started calling out for ""Ivana Tinkle"", with her clutching her mouth in an obvious attempt at restraining her laughter upon his first calling out the name, implying she immediately realized Moe was being duped.
 Ruth was later imprisoned for a short time during this for another offense, which is unspecified. While she was in prison, Ruth built up her muscles and became a bodybuilder, which earned the title ""Miss Mexican Mafia"" and took steroids to expand her muscles. Noticing her old neighbor while on a jog at Springfield's muscle beach and pier, Marge reunited with Ruth where they shared their interests in bodybuilding and where Ruth introduced her to taking steroids. Later in The Simpsons Movie, Ruth was shown joining the angry mob that attempted to kill Homer, and possibly the other Simpsons, for getting the town sealed in a dome. Ruth's house was sold to Sideshow Bob (disguised as Walt Warren). The Powers later moved in again, as in a neighborhood meeting at the Simpson house, Ruth told Marge she hasn't ""stopped by to say hello in 25 years, and I live next door"".

Sideshow Mel,True,True,False,False,False,2,Castellaneta,119,"Melvin Van Horne (also known as Sideshow Mel) is Krusty's current sidekick on The Krusty the Clown Show, after Sideshow Bob. When he is not in character, Mel speaks in a grandiose English/Shakespearean/British accent and owns a lot of poodles. He is a recurring character in The Simpsons and a minor antagonist in The Simpsons Movie.
 Mel as a dice. Mel joined the cast of the Krusty the Clown Show to replace Sideshow Bob, who was sentenced to prison for attempting to frame Krusty for armed robbery.  Mel with his son. Sideshow Mel uses a slide whistle to communicate on camera. When not in character, Mel speaks in a grandiose English/Shakespearean accent and owns many poodles. His main accomplishment so far has been successfully removing Mr. Smithers from suspicion of having shot Mr. Burns. Off-screen, Mel is generally very eloquent, educated, poetic and intelligent, with a beautiful singing voice - it is implied that as with Sideshow Bob before him, his true talents are wasted on Krusty's show. He attended Cornell University. When Lisa Simpson won the ""Entertainer of the Year Award,"" it was revealed that Melvin also won the award previously for his portrayal of Biff in Death of a Salesman, but his desire to keep his stardom eventually led him to become the sidekick he is today. He was once forced to conduct an orchestra of kazoo-playing monkeys. When he pleaded with Krusty to not force him to do it, Krusty simply shouted at him to ""shut up and conduct"".
 Although ultimately loyal to Krusty, he also is known to not be a doormat to some of Krusty's antics. In one instance, when Krusty's 29th anniversary was occurring, one of the clips that was to be shown was Mel, while drunk on ""wowie-sauce"", made clear that he viewed Krusty as a word that can't be repeated, unlike the others who kissed Krusty's butt. In addition, when the series was about to get canceled, Mel ended up quitting citing the abuse he frequently had to undergo, although he ultimately ends up returning to Krusty's side by the time of the Comeback Special.
 He was apparently a fan of the Cosmic Wars franchise since childhood, and like several other people hated Episodes I, II, and III, as when he saw in the opening blurb for Episode VII: A New Take that the aforementioned episodes had been erased from continuity via a space-time rift, he not only celebrated with the others at the news, but also proceeded to declare his childhood ""unruined.""
 Mel tends to dramatically point out anything notable (though obvious) to various sized crowds around him, which he does more often in later episodes. He also seems to have some kind of friendship with Moe.
 Sideshow Mel is blowing the slidewhistle. Little is known about Mel, aside from him being a Cornell University graduate. It is also shown that Mel could be a recovering alcoholic as he had attended several Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Although he is occasionally seen at the Presbylutheran church, Mel was retroactively an atheist until the episode ""Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass,"" where he converted to religion after watching Ned's home movies depicting Bible stories. He also seemed to have disgust for atheism in spite of his formerly being that, as in ""Sky Police"", when imagining the worst that could happen if Homer ends up inadvertently blowing their operation to save the church, he imagines alongside the rest of the plotters the destruction of the church and it being replaced with an Atheist Strip Club and reacts with horror and disgust at the idea.
 Aside from the bone, Mel has a light blue curly hair in a sort of the beehive-like style similar to Marge's, only shorter and rounded at the top. His hair also appears to be ""fashioned/poised/set"" in an upward position because it seems to sit atop his head, showing that he has no sideburns or even a hair ""tail"". Mel perpetually wears a bone in his hair, which may or may not be permanently affixed. He once warned Lisa not to use a bone to try and get gum out of her hair, as he did and it became permanently stuck there. However, he has been seen removing the bone to use it as a weapon during a duel, and to whack at the dome under which Springfield was trapped by the EPA. Bart also took the bone out of his hair to prank Martin Prince, after which Mel was shown to have long flowing hair. Homer also took the bone out of his hair and used it as a murdering weapon. He indicated that he could feel meteorological conditions in the bone, such as incoming storms. Before he got his bone, Mel was famous in both London and Hollywood and was able to comb his hair.
 The comic ""All Fired Up"" reveals that the main purpose of the bone is to hold Mel's hair up in the beehive-like style; if the bone is removed, his hair will drop into a style so beautiful that he gets attacked by a swarm of ladies on sight (something he particularly doesn't like).
 Mel wacking the dome with his bone. It was revealed in ""Bart Gets Famous"" that Sideshow Mel was lactose-intolerant when Bart gave him a grilled cheese sandwich.
 He may be married to or living with a woman named Barbara, who may or may not be Krusty's sister with whom he wished to purchase a house from Marge Simpson. Mel once complained that Barbara no longer pleasured him with the French Arts. It is revealed that he has at least one child when he says ""Krusty, please, my wife is giving birth as we speak."" He has also been seen with a son, Warren, a daughter, Becca, and several unnamed children. Mel also has a deceased father, whose funeral he attended shortly before performing at an ice rink with Krusty. He once said his father was a monster.
 Mel may be divorced from Barbara or another wife or girlfriend. The papers say he is having a contentious custody battle with the mother of at least one of his children (""Homerazzi"").
 Barbara was reconfigured/redesigned in Barbara Belfry in the episodes "" A Serious Flanders: Part One"" and ""A Serious Flanders: Part Two"", where they are in an open relationship. However, she is not canon.
 Krusty reveals to Mel that he has been secretly having an affair with Mel's wife, and that he wants to dump her after 11 years since the thrill is gone.
 After Krusty's show was cancelled following the rise of Gabbo, Mel worked at a fast food restaurant where he initially refused Krusty's pleas to return to his show.
 He was the jury foreman for the Mona Simpson trial. The jury was sequestered at a Quality Inn which ""more than lived up to its name.""
 In a comic, it is revealed he was a racer and got 15 trophies, and maybe he earned even more.
 He has his own comic story of how he became a sideshow, where his parents and house are present.

Troy McClure,True,False,False,True,False,2,Castellaneta,120,"Trodden ""Troy"" McClure is a cheesy B-movie actor who had fallen on hard times. He was often seen shilling for shoddy products or hosting questionable shows. He appeared from Season 2 until Season 10. Since then, Troy along with two other Phil Hartman characters were retired due to his death.
 McClure was a stereotypical Hollywood has-been, reduced to appearing in low quality films and television presenting jobs. During the early seventies he had a highly successful acting career, but it had since become worse. He often appeared in short video clips seen on television or in a public place. He often was shown presenting educational videos and infomercials. When introducing anything that he does, McClure lists projects that he has previously done with the phrase ""Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such  as..."" and will mention two or three titles of a similar subject to that of the current performance he is giving.
 McClure's career went downhill due to his reported unusual paraphilia, which apparently involved fish, to the point where he had not worked in twelve years. To cover this up, he began a relationship with Selma Bouvier, whom he had met when she gave him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles. This revived his career, leading him to star in Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!, a musical version of the film Planet of the Apes. To further revive his career, McClure's agent suggested that he marry Selma, a proposal which she accepted. At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure told Homer Simpson that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. At the wedding, an unknowing Selma married Troy. She eventually discovered that their marriage was a sham and, although she accepted it, she drew the line when McClure's agent suggested that the pair have a child. As ""all the big parts these days are going to family men"", having a child would have secured McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in McBain IV: Fatal Discharge. Having rejected his offer, Selma left McClure. As a result, McClure starred in his own independent film The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.
 In addition to his appearances within episodes, McClure presented the episodes ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"" and ""The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"". The first is a behind the scenes look at The Simpsons, answering questions and featuring extra ""never before seen"" material. The second is an episode presenting three possible spin-offs from The Simpsons. Troy made his last speaking appearance in the Season 10 episode ""Bart the Mother"".
 McClure was based on the typical ""washed up"" Hollywood actor, with inspiration for his character and name being drawn from B-movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure. Mike Reiss later met Doug McClure's daughter who revealed that her father had found the homage funny and McClure's children would call their father Troy McClure when his back was turned. Phil Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull ""the maximum amount of humor"" out of any line he was given, and McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. McClure drives a 1981 De Lorean DMC-12. McClure lives in his home, resembling the one from the movie 'Body Double', in the upscale residential area of ""Springfield Heights"", which is also resided by Mob boss ""Fat"" Tony D'Amico and entertainer Krusty the Clown.
 McClure's character is developed in ""A Fish Called Selma"", when a more in-depth look into his private life is shown. The episode is the only one in the entire run of the series that shows true emotion from Troy McClure. It is hinted that he has Ichthyophilia, sexual desires for fish. Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were big fans of Phil Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give him as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of him marrying Selma Bouvier, as she was ""always marrying people"". Having Troy McClure as the star of the episode pleased Animator Mark Kirkland, as he found McClure's voice great to animate to, allowing him and other animators to ""open him up visually as a character"". It is hinted throughout the course of the episode that he has strange sexual behavior. Throughout the production of the episode, the writers did not know what the ""unsavory"" sexual preference was. They decided on a fish fetish, an idea James L. Brooks suggested as it was ""so perverted and strange, it was over the top"". McClure's apparent fish fetish was mentioned by The Guardian in their article about a Swiss scientist's discovery that sticklebacks ejaculate more sperm after they have seen images of fish flirting.
 The last appearance of Troy McClure. The last films he mentions are Earwigs, Eww and Man VS Nature: the Road to Victory. Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife Brynn before taking her own life on May 28, 1998. Rather than replace Hartman with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other characters Lionel Hutz, and Billy often in his films from the show. He last appeared in the season ten episode ""Bart the Mother"". Before his death, Phil Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a live action film about McClure, with several of the show's writers wanting to help make it. Josh Weinstein stated that the plot of ""A Fish Called Selma"" could have worked well as a live action film. Matt Groening later told Empire that the idea never ""got further than enthusiasm"" but that ""it would have been really fun.""
 Hartman was cast before his death as Zapp Brannigan in Matt Groening's Futurama. Billy West took over the role, and based his vocal performance on Hartman's characterizations, particularly McClure.
 Despite being retired, he is pictured in ""The Simpsons Guy"".
 He also appears in a pixel art form in the opening sequence made for ""My Fare Lady"".
 Troy appearing in the opening of ""My Fare Lady"", pixeled. In a 2006 article IGN.com ranked McClure in first position on their list of the ""Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters"", citing that he is ""a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can be."" In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes McClure in detail citing that he, along with Lionel Hutz, ""represent the most significant contribution to the show outside its permanent cast"" and that ""the show's Golden Age is hard to imagine without them"". McClure became the perfect portrayal of a media stereotype and a ""gut-achingly funny reinterpretation"" of a character type that had been ""done to death"". Adam Finley named Phil Hartman one of the five best guest stars on The Simpsons, saying that McClure was ""responsible for some of the funniest moments in Simpsons history."" Star News Online named Hartman as one of the four hundred reasons why they loved The Simpsons, adding that they missed McClure. The Observer listed McClure educational films Smoke Yourself Thin; Get Confident, Stupid!; Firecrackers: the Silent Killer and Fuzzy Bunny's Guide to You-know-what as part of their list of the three hundred reasons why they loved the show.
 McClure's most prominent episode, ""A Fish Called Selma"", is often regarded as one of the best episodes in the show's history, and is one of the top five favorites of the staff. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode eighth on their top 25 The Simpsons episode list. IGN.com named the episode the best of the seventh season, stating that it seemed the ""obvious pick"". They also called the Planet of the Apes musical, which McClure stars in, the best moment of the episode and ""maybe even the whole show"". Associated Content also praised the musical, naming it the ninth best musical number in The Simpsons history. McClure was made into an action figure as part of the World of Springfield toy line, and was released in the ""Celebrity Series 1"" wave. He also features briefly in the video game Virtual Springfield, introducing the town of Springfield to the player.
 A recent book on Phil Hartman is entitled You Might Remember Me, after McClure's signature catch phrase that he introduces himself with.

Hans Moleman,True,False,False,True,True,2,Castellaneta,122,"Young Hans Moleman (as seen in ""Walking Big &amp; Tall"") Hans Moleman (also known as Ralph Melish, born August 2) is a mole-like man with extremely bad luck.
 He is best known for his 10-second short film Man Getting Hit by Football in ""A Star Is Burns"". There is a running gag in the series of him getting killed by various accidents, yet returning unharmed and alive later on. Because of this, some fans refer to him as The Simpsons version of Kenny McCormick.
 Moleman first appeared in the Tracy Ullman short ""Scary Movie"" (without glasses) sleeping in the cinema, but wakes up when Bart screams. He was silent then. He looked different in that short, showing a prototype version of him. He was officially introduced as a speaking, unlucky character in the episode ""Principal Charming""; however, his driver's license listed his name as ""Ralph Melish"".
 He has cataracts and is almost entirely blind (which has severely impaired his reading ability). He carries a brown cane with him everywhere, which was once shown to contain a hidden sword.
 Hans was once mistaken for Bart and accidentally had his brain ""re-programmed"" (Homer and Marge had hired a cult re-programmer, hoping to convince Bart to move out of Mr. Burns' mansion and back in with them), apparently leading him to believe he is the son of Homer and Marge.
 Homer once stumbled across Hans Moleman as the leader of a race of Mole People in an underground fortress complete with earthquake machines. In the opening credits for The Simpsons, Marge strikes Moleman with her car. He has some jobs such as a mailman and a janitor (in the episode where Homer gets good luck).
 His home address is 920 Oak Grove, Springfield. 
 His original driver license, which said he was born in 1921, was voided in ""Principal Charming"". He got a new one in ""Black Widower"", presumably the one voided in ""Selma's Choice"", which listed his year of birth as 1961. 
 Like most of Springfield's residents, Hans Moleman is of the Protestant Christian faith and is frequently seen at church. In ""The Springfield Connection"", he is seen with Reverend Lovejoy before his execution.
 Hans Moleman once attended Springfield University for a short time, only so that he could have somewhere to sit. It is unknown how long he attended the school and whether he gained any credits.
 In ""Walking Big &amp; Tall"", it is revealed that Hans Moleman was once the mayor of Springfield.
 There appears to be a continuity error involving his age:

Groundskeeper Willie,True,False,False,True,False,2,Castellaneta,123,"Groundskeeper Willy Dr. William ""Willie"" MacDougal III (Scots Gaelic: Uilleam MacDhùghaill), also known as William Sean McLavel, G.K. Willington Esquire, and William MacMoran, best known as Groundskeeper Willie (Scots Gaelic: Fear-gleidhidh talmhainn Uilleam) is the groundskeeper and janitor of Springfield Elementary School and a minor character in The Simpsons Movie who's originally from Scotland. Willie's job is to supervise the children of the school during recess, and clean the halls. He is recognizable for his red hair and thick Scottish accent. He is often either a formidable enemy or an invaluable ally to Bart and Lisa Simpson; mostly, he has a strained relationship with Principal Seymour Skinner. Willie's either originally from the Scottish town of Kirkwall or a place called North Kilttown, which is likely a reference to the hamlet of Domaduir, near Kyle of Lochalsh. Willie is 45 years old.
 Willie as Greenskeeper. Younger Willie Willie is the groundskeeper at Springfield Elementary School and is a stereotypical angry Scotsman with a heavy Scottish accent. He worked in the same amount of years as Principal Skinner. He was originally hired at Springfield Elementary as ""Swim Teacher Willie."" Unfortunately, after Skinner was trapped in the worm-filled pool for three days, he had the pool destroyed, and made Willie a groundskeeper. On weekends and during summer vacations, Willie tends to the golf course at the Springfield Glen Country Club, giving himself the appropriate renaming of ""Greenskeeper Willie."" He has claimed to originate from several different places in Scotland, and frequently gives contradictory accounts of his past life before arriving in Springfield. Willie once told a story of working at a mine that caved in, saying ""No one made it out alive, not even Willie!"" Also Willie once told Skinner that he had seen his own father hanged for stealing a pig although both of his parents can be seen alive in Scotland later. It is possible that Willie has a murderous past as we are told he is the spitting image of the Aberdeen Strangler, an affirmation which he doesn't deny, innocently whistling by. However, it is likely he only kills unintentionally: he accidentally killed the boy who became the playground ghost of Springfield Elementary, all because of his sassy mouth.
 Willie is incompetent and is quick to anger for little or no reason. He has shown great animosity towards both Principal Skinner and Bart Simpson, the latter of whom is often more than willing to make Willie the butt of his jokes. Twice, Bart destroyed Willie's shack: the first out of revenge for taking his skateboard; the second accidentally. Superintendent Chalmers once said that he never yelled at Willie like he does at Skinner because he liked him. At one time, Skinner quit and Chalmers replaced him with Willie as both Principal and Groundskeeper, though he never increased his salary, much to the Scotsman's disappointment.
 Groundskeeper Willie playing and singing ""I'm a maniac, maniac, that's for sure..."". Willie once discovered an oil well by accident because he was attempting to bury the school hamster. Because of the school's new wealth, he requested a crystal pail. However, after Mr. Burns stole the oil, which not only resulted in the loss of the school's newly gained fortune, but also causing the school to go into an even worse financial state than before due to the cost of dismantling the oil tower, Skinner was forced to lay off Groundskeeper Willie, in order to preserve the remaining school budget, causing Willie to wish to murder Mr. Burns and seriously injure Mr. Smithers. When interrogated by the police, he answers that he wasn't able to because of arthritis in both of his index fingers, preventing him from utilizing a pistol, which he got ""from Space Invaders in 1977"" and implying right after that he doesn't even know what a video game is, asking ignorantly ""Video game?"" and therefore pretending to have fought aliens for real. However, he fired a rifle at a weather balloon vandalized by Bart; it's as if handling a pistol and handling a rifle are two separate things to him. Later, he was seen shooting an empty pistol in the Springfield County Court House with pinpoint accuracy, indicating that his arthritis may have been fixed. He once had a cache of ""screw you money"", but he ended up losing it all, presumably due to Artie Ziff cheating out ZiffCorp's shareholders.
 Willie's hobbies include videotaping couples in cars, something which proves to the benefit of Homer Simpson when he is wrongfully accused of sexual harassment. At one time, Willie was engaged to Shary Bobbins until she recovered her eyesight—at which point, in Willie's words, ""Suddenly the ugliest man in Glasgow wasn't good enough for her!"" Willie was once given the job of teaching Bart Simpson. Lisa had taken a restraining order against Bart, so he couldn't legally go to the same school. Willie became Bart's teacher because, according to Principal Skinner, Willie's shack is the only place on the school grounds that ""falls outside all laws of Man or God.""
 Groundskeeper Willie tearing off his shirt. He also took part in the Medieval Festival, but he disrupted it and Principal Skinner expelled Bart who had mistaken him as the one who disrupted it; Willie later explained to Skinner that he was the one who was disrupted the festival. Principal Skinner then realized his mistake and welcomed Bart back as an apology and was then scolded along with Willie by Superintendent Chalmers for expelling the wrong culprit. He also held a particular hatred for the holiday of Easter, which he implied was because of his Scottish ancestry. This hatred was such that he proceeded to sabotage a celebration of the holiday by rigging the various musical instruments with eggs, thus having the band unknowingly spray eggs at the audience when playing the instruments, and then framing Bart for it, which was serious enough to nearly get Bart expelled from school and worse. After he was exposed, it was implied that he lost his job as groundskeeper and spent a few years at the Penitentiary as a result (although oddly, he has his job back by the next episode).
 Willie's years of heavy work have given him amazing strength and a very muscular physique, which has been observed many times as he often tears his clothes off, before accomplishing hard tasks or because of outbursts of rage. For example, he rescues Bart from a marauding Alaskan timber wolf by wrestling it into submission. Much like Ned Flanders, though, his physique is unremarkable when he is clothed, and seemingly morphs as soon as he is partially nude. Apparently, he has had sexual attractions to Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York (more commonly known as ""Fergie""), as he had mentioned while hallucinating as an after effect of Seth and Munchie's Peyote-laced juice (which was thanks to Homer) that he waited a long time for the moment where he could embrace Fergie passionately.
 Willie is recognizable for his thick, angry Scottish accent and his shaggy mane of red hair and scruffy beard. Willie's fiery temper, drinking problem and dysfunctional stability and crazyness in his own life make him unfit to be around, let alone take after children and the only reason that he seems to be able to keep his job is because Skinner and Chalmers pay him relatively nothing for his groundskeeping duties.
 It is implied that Willie has killed a student at least twice. When a ball was shredded underneath his tractor, he screams in horror that he ran over another child again. He claims to be haunted by the ghost of a deceased student when he confused Bart for him and after Bart left the scene, a young ghost actually did appear with a rake impaled through its chest (insinuating murder or at the very least manslaughter). Willie is homeless and lives in his utility shack on the school grounds which is heavily dilapidated (on one occasion he dreamt that he was in his shack when he was actually passed out drunk in a snowy field). His shack has been destroyed twice (both times because of Bart) when he overflowed it with creamed corn out of revenge for Willie stealing his skateboard and the second time was accidentally demolished by a frozen dodge-ball which was intended at his gym teacher. Despite its shabbiness, Willie is emotionally attached to his shack as he missed it greatly when he quit his job and became a waiter, and also was devastated after the first time Bart destroyed the shack, which partly led to him vowing revenge on Bart later on.
 Groundskeeper Willie Willie has a very bizarre way of speaking. His heavy accent makes most of his sentences sound nonsensical and complete gibberish. His writing sentences are also heavily accented to match how he speaks, implying he is also illiterate. Whenever Willie insults someone he goes into a long-drafted retort that is gruffly spoken such as ""you cheese-eating, surrender monkeys"" to a class of French students and ""you nose-combing, hair-wipers"" to Skinner and Chalmers. His thick accent also results in even simple terms being difficult to understand, as during Nelson's punishment for stealing various items, Willie tried to tell Nelson to activate a hose, but because of it coming out as ""hoose"", Nelson mistook it for ""moose."" It's implied that Willie's speech pattern is a result of brain damage due to a constant concussion by hitting himself on the head with a hammer to get to sleep.
 Willie is a heavy drinker and is usually quite drunk on the job. In these instances he drives his tractor, swerving drunkenly and ploughing everything in his way, once crashing into the pool by accident. He claims to ""get so drunk I can barely see, but it helps me get through another day"". Despite this, Willie seems to have a passion for his job such as keeping the lost retainers that he finds from children and turning them into a sculpture. Even after Lisa gave him a better life as a waiter and with a presumably higher pay rise, Willie still missed his old job as a groundskeeper. Indeed, he often seems to pursue similar jobs when School is closed and thus his services aren't actually needed there, as implied by his acting as ""Greenskeeper Willie"" for the local golf course, being attached to this job to such an extent that he gets angered when he receives competition in the form of Bart to the extent of stealing the latter's pay as revenge.
 Willie regularly fights animals such as an Alaskan timber wolf and a donkey, with the intention of eating the latter after holding him down. However, he is quite fond of animals such as giving the timber wolf a drink from his own flask after being victorious, planning to rescue the turtles when the school fire alarm was pulled but was overpowered by them later on, reacting with joy when Santa's Little Helper noticed him through a window and giving a snake a home as a fire hose for the school when he was abandoned by Bart.
 Outside of his groundskeeping tendencies, Willie seems to work for Mayor Quimby and the town in general. Presumably due to his constant manual labor Willie is in excellent physique whenever he rips off his clothes and reveals he is actually very muscular which is odd as his clothes tend to give him a pot belly.
 He is implied to have an infatuation with Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, as when unknowingly consuming a drink laced with hallucinogenic drugs, he proceeded to hallucinate her presence near a tree and her beckoning him to come near her due to his ""completing her"", with his being all too happy to oblige, even admitting he always dreamed of this moment, also injuring himself due to scratching his face with a rake repeatedly due to mistaking it for her.
 Willie as Freddy Kreuger in Treehouse of Horror VI. Willie has a tendency to get killed in the Treehouse of Horror episodes, getting killed three times in Treehouse of Horror V (by Homer Simpson, Maggie Simpson and Principal Skinner), each time he attempts to be helpful or heroic, and each time he is felled by an axe in the back (he mutters, ""Ach, I'm bad at this."" after the third time). He is also killed in Treehouse of Horror VI by accidentally being burned to death (and later attempting to get revenge on the PTA's children in their nightmares as Freddy Krueger, although he somehow ends up being revived shortly after Maggie kills him in their dreams), in Treehouse of Horror XI by a dolphin, in Treehouse of Horror XVI he is strafed and killed by Burns, in Treehouse of Horror XVIII by getting his head cut off by the tractor, and in Treehouse of Horror XIX by being eaten by the Grand Pumpkin although this doesn't really kill him as the Grand Pumpkin is hollow inside. In ""Treehouse of Horror XXV"", he uses the Simpson children's dead bodies to make stew, and it is also implied that he killed Maggie.
 Willie appears as one of the contestants in the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge in the level Around the World in 80 Bites - he blocks off the Scotland area from the other contestants until it is opened by Bart. In the ending cutscene of the level, he also ends up re-enacting the famous final words of Planet of the Apes when seeing the destroyed Statue of Liberty, causing Comic Book Guy while walking by to criticize him. He also appears in Mob Rules as one of the people Marge can use in her mob to protest the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy videogame to minors.

 Groundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in ""Principal Charming"". Originally, the character was just written as an angry janitor, and the fact that he was Scottish was added during a recording session. Dan Castellaneta was assigned to do the voice. Castellaneta didn't know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, told Castellaneta to use an accent. He first tried using a Spanish voice, which Simon felt was too clichéd. He then tried a ""big dumb Swede"", which was also rejected. For his third try, he used the voice of an angry Scotsman, which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode. Originally thought by the directors to be a one-shot appearance, Willie has since become a common recurring character. Matt Groening would later reveal that the character was based on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show Second City Television, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas.
 A recurring joke, which was first shown in ""Radio Bart"", is that Willie appears to have a pot belly, but whenever he takes off his shirt, he is quite muscular. One of Willie's trademarks is a gruffly-spoken insulting retort, which take the writers a long time to come up with, although they do not consider them that funny.
 ""The most instantly recognizable Scot in the world."" Groundskeeper Willie's description of the French as ""cheese-eating surrender monkeys"" from the episode ""'Round Springfield"" has become widely used, particularly in the run-up to the war in Iraq. The New York Post used the phrase ""Surrender Monkeys"" as the headline for its December 7, 2006 front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group and its recommendation that U.S. soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by early 2008. The line was ""most likely"" written by Ken Keeler.
 The Times reported in late 2005 that ""he is the most instantly recognizable Scot in the world: better known than Billy Connolly or Ewan McGregor, even Sean Connery."" The same article quotes Simpsons creator Matt Groening as saying ""We wanted to create a school janitor that was filled with rage, sort of our tribute to angry janitors all over the world"".
 In 2006, Groundskeeper Willie would be named the fourth best peripheral character in the history of the show by IGN, who said ""high-points for the character were being trained to be civilized, wrestling a wolf that was let loose in the school and becoming a substitute for the French language teacher - 'Bon jourrr! You cheese-eating surrender monkeys!'"" IGN would also name ""My Fair Laddy"", the only episode which centers around Willie, the best episode of the seventeenth season. Jim Slotek of Sun Media would call Willie the ninth best Simpsons supporting character, and also made a Top Ten quotes list, which included Willie's quote ""Och, back to the loch wi' you, Nessie."" from ""Selma's Choice"".
 There have been some moments in the show where he has been known to imitate Montgomery Scott of Star Trek fame.

Lindsey Naegle,False,True,False,False,False,8,MacNeille,124,"Lindsey Naegle (aka Red) is a resident of Springfield and is often known as Springfield's residential business link.
 Lindsey is understood to be a common youth-hater. Outraged at having paid high damage fees for a particular riot that the youth had caused, she formed an anti-youth group, SSCCATAGAPP (Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens and Gays against Parasitic Parents), and lobbied to deprive Springfield of all child-friendly things. Her campaign nearly succeeded, but it was thwarted at the last moment when Bart, Lisa, and the other kids in Springfield hugged all the adults, infecting them with ""kid germs."" The adults collapsed with sickness and became unable to vote, causing the campaign to fail.
 Lindsey is an alcoholic (she said so matter-of-factly to Lenny when she was asked why she was in Moe’s Tavern). Despite this she is the head of the Alcoholics Anonymous branch in Springfield.
 She is often seen as a member of the Springfield Republican Party. However, she was once seen attending a Democratic Party meeting. She is also a member of the Springfield Book Club, and was the person who caused the town to finally crack under the strain of being trapped in the dome when she threw a book at Helen Lovejoy, only to for it to miss and spill the coffee in the adjacent Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
 Lindsey tends to flatly admit things that might be considered insensitive. She admitted to being a sexual predator, and once said that she cannot cry due to a botched face lift.
 In ""Homer Goes to Prep School"", she's a member of the Doomsday preppers along with Gary Chalmers, Herman Hermann, L.T. Smash and Lloyd. When Superintendent Chalmers demonstrated a rifle scope that makes any human face look dangerous and threatening (by placing an angry brow appearance on people's faces), he pretended to shoot her holding it. She asks what it was for, and he says ""You thought I've gone mad with power, weren't you?"". Lindsey responds ""I wasn't but I am now."" and Chalmers pretended to shoot her a couple more times.
 Lindsey has popped up in several capacities, seemingly working at a different job every time she appears. Job titles have included the aforementioned network executive, as well as marketing researcher, financial planner, public relations consultant, venture capitalist, advertising executive, cell phone company executive, insurance salesperson, and executive with the Child Development Group. After she introduced herself (again) to Homer and Marge, Marge said, “We’ve met you many times, Ms. Naegle. Why do you keep changing jobs?” Lindsey flatly replied, “I’m a sexual predator.” Her business card reads ""Lindsey Naegle: Does Everything"".
 Due to her role as a business and network executive figure, Lindsey (like any business CEO or network executive in the media) tends to over commercialize anything that she has creative control over, which causes initial problems for other characters, based on the plot of the episode.
 In ""The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show"", Lindsey was part of the committee of writers at Itchy &amp; Scratchy International, who felt that the character Poochie should be edgy, have plenty of attitude, and be ""Rasta-fied"" by 10 percent, as well as ""proactive"" and a ""totally outrageous paradigm"". However, due to Poochie's unpopularity with the audience, Lindsey along with the rest of the writers decide to kill him off. Even though Homer implores the audience to give Poochie a fair chance (instead of reading the intended script), the character is edited out at the last second, leaving Homer feeling betrayed, as he put his soul into the character he voiced.
 In ""Girly Edition"", Lindsey tells Krusty the Clown that the FCC feels that kids aren't learning anything from The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show and that they need educational programming. She then suggest a kid-oriented news show called ""Kidz News"", where the network would cut ten minutes out of The Krusty the Clown Show. During the run of the news show, Lisa Simpson is recruited as a news anchor, while Bart is later chosen and made a sportscaster. After Bart livens up the show, Lindsey promotes him to co-anchor, which makes Lisa jealous. Lisa proclaims that she doesn't need a co-anchor, Lindsey tells her that Bart has what she doesn't: ""Zazz!"", ""Zing!"", ""Zork!"", and ""Kapowza!"" Despite Lisa's reasoning of that trivializes the entire idea of Kidz Newz, her argument goes unanswered. After Bart and Lisa choose to resolve the disputes and make a good educational news program, they are abruptly canceled in favor of ""The Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Choc-O-Bot Hour"".
 When Ned Flanders considered remarrying, he went to a dating service where he saw a video of Lindsey promoting herself as a girlfriend very much akin to a cover letter. Ned took Lindsey out to dinner, where she continued talking about herself until she got a fax and excused herself. Presumably that date went poorly as Ned was later seen dating other women.
 She is an enthusiastic practitioner of the child-free lifestyle, and at one point spearheaded a movement to make Springfield less child-friendly. Once romantically linked with Judge Roy Snyder, she is a graduate from the Wharton Business School. She is a stereotypical upper-management executive, and her ventures frequently feature the business buzzword “synergy”.
 Lindsey Naegle once made out with Marge Simpson during Homer's imagination, despite Marge not being a lesbian.
 It is been implied that at one time she had been sleeping with Krusty the Clown.
 Marge told Homer that, if she passed on, he would be allowed to marry Lindsey; this is seen on a list in the back of his closet. Ironically, Lindsey was in the bank with Marge when she gave Homer this permission.
 Lindsey's anti-child attitude was spoofed in a story in ""Margical History Tour"" where she plays Anne Boleyn. She marries Homer, who plays King Henry VIII, on the basis she can get pregnant with a son for him. However, she is executed after she gives King Henry a daughter.
 When Homer imagines accidents resulting during a time that he was uninsured, Lindsey Naegle and Marge Simpson started making out after they were the only ones who survived besides Homer Simpson.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XIX,"" in the opening of ""How to Get Ahead in Dead-Vertising"", she is in one of the pictures on the buildings.
 In ""The Serfsons,"" Lindsey Naegle and Krusty are dating. Krusty ends up transmitting his ""Genital Snerfs"" (Smurfs) to Lindsey, which toss their hats and sing.
 Her original design.

Poochie,True,False,False,False,False,8,stars,125,"
 Poochie is a character on The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show. The network executives decided that the show needed an ""update"" to keep the interest of its audience, so they devised Poochie, a cartoon dog ""with an attitude"". Poochie has a song, the Poochie rap.
 Poochie's first appearance After widespread auditions, Homer was chosen to provide Poochie's voice. The character debuted to an unreceptive audience following a massive publicity campaign; he only served to interfere with the well-oiled machine of hyper-violent slapstick that Itchy and Scratchy had perfected over the years. 
 When dissatisfied viewers flooded the network with letters crying for Poochie's immediate removal, if not death, the executives quickly decided to get rid of the character. Homer begged for another chance, insisting that Poochie would grow on the audience; this argument held little weight until the actress who performed voices for both Itchy and Scratchy declared her support for Poochie as well.
 Homer was shocked, however, when the next cartoon aired: it contained a hastily-animated, re-dubbed segment in which Poochie, voiced by Roger Meyers, Jr. instead of Homer, stated he had decided to return to his ""home planet."" Dialogue written in bloody letters across the screen read, ""Note: Poochie died on the way back to his home planet,"" and cuts immediately back to Krusty telling kids happily, ""Poochie's dead!"", much to Homer's dismay, and even providing an affidavit that promises to prevent the character's revival in any shape or form. Bart tells Homer that maybe the world could be ready to Poochie in a few years.
 Despite his death, however, he made a brief non-speaking cameo in the Itchy and Scratchy episode The Tears of a Clone at Scratchy's funeral, hinting that he revived or possibly a continuity error. He also appeared in the episode ""The Bashin' of the Christ"", appearing on his skate board with a halo and cross saying ""And then this happened!!"".
 He appears periodically on merchandise such as dolls and T-shirts. They were implied to still be fairly unpopular, as Bart, at the time substituting ownership of The Android's Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop alongside Milhouse while its usual owner was recovering from a near-fatal heart attack, told the latter to put the Poochie-related merchandise on clearance. Possibly a parody of the ""nostalgia"" trends of consumer culture. Even mascots of Poochie are used such as one portraying Neo from The Matrix during the Krusty's Kristmas on Ice Show. In ""Springfield Splendor,"" two people at the Bi-Mon Sci-Fi-Con cosplaying as Itchy and Scratchy give disapproving looks to a third person dressed as Poochie.
 Poochie (or perhaps a human costumed as him) is seen with nunchucks pursuing Bart and Lisa up a tree in Dogtown.
 Poochie had a cameo in the segment The Terror of Tiny Toon skateboarding down the street before being hit by a police car driven by Itchy and Scratchy.
 Poochie makes a cameo as Action Figure in the segment Be Nine, Rewind.
 He is the main enemy on the Grand Theft Scratchy level, where he acts and speaks like a rapper. After Marge and Lisa re-form the Ice Cream cars, Poochie talks to the Feline ""ho's"" watching the show, ordering them to ""put a cap in  asses"" by destroying the cars. Using her Hand of Buddha, Lisa defeats the prostitutes, while Marge sends the dogs to destroy the stage on which Poochie stands. Marge apologized and told him that ""even he isn't a match for a stay-at-home mom with too much time on her hands."" When Lisa agrees with Marge, Poochie only tells her ""Word to  Mother."" He also witnesses the senator being killed by a falling sign.
 When doing his introduction, he briefly swears, as he yells ""P TO THE DOUBLE-O ""CH"" I E / I'M THE DOG ON  WHO'S TO THE EXTREME""
 He's a mascot character in Krustyland and a parade balloon in Springfield. The real Poochie was later added in the Itchy &amp; Scratchy event, when the cartoon characters became real.

Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,False,False,False,True,False,7,stars,126,"Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon is the wife of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and the mother of the Nahasapeemapetilon Octuplets.
 Manjula was arranged to be married to Apu Nahasapeemapetilon when she was three, in which she looked forward to it all her life, but Apu was to set out to the United States for college. She occasionally works at the Kwik-E-Mart alongside Apu, but she is usually seen as a homemaker. She claims that Fried Green Tomatoes is her favorite book, movie and food. When the octuplets are born, she sternly informs Apu that he cannot pass on until they are out of college.
 She has excellent culinary skills, demonstrated by her ability to make a wide variety of dishes using only chickpeas, lentils, and rice, or sometimes only chickpeas and lentils. She says when Apu dies, she will sell the store and marry Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon. She is shown to be very judgmental and nitpicks at nearly everything Apu does, as well as Marge during their meetings at the Midday Mommies club.
 Manjula is also the ""Octuplet-Wrangling Super-Breeder"" type of mom you meet at the PTA.
 Her character was never formally retired after her original voice actress Jan Hooks died in 2014 as Tress MacNeille had already replaced her for twelve years. Nevertheless, her character only spoke once more after Hooks's death and due to the Controversy surrounding Apu and by extension herself it is unclear that she will make any future appearances.
 Manjula is shown to have a fair-weathered friendship with Marge Simpson, much like the rest of the women Marge hangs out with. Manjula cares for her babies, but sometimes she gets stressed like Apu Nahasapeemapetilon; when he told her of a wonderful dream he had involving his death, she refused to allow him to die before the octuplets left college.
 Her relationship with Apu has not always been in good condition. When Manjula discovered that working 18 hours a day including weekends was not how Americans worked, she got mad at Apu, since she thought he didn't want to see her. He compensated for this with seven surprises for Manjula before Valentine's Day, though he nearly suffocated due to being encased in chocolate for one surprise. Apu once had an affair with Annette Taylor. After Homer Simpson discovered this, he and Marge revealed their discovery to Apu, who eventually caved into the guilt and vowed to apologize to Manjula. However, she already knew it from surveillance tapes at the Kwik-E-Mart and kicked Apu out of the house. With some help from the Simpson family, Manjula eventually agreed to give Apu another chance after he completed an often-vengeful list of bizarre grueling tasks fashioned by her, such as performing ""My Fair Lady"" with the octuplets. Since then, their relationship has been strained, with the couple seen attending marriage counseling, though their relationship may have been improved by the Trappuccino ordeal as they were seen kissing and celebrating their liberation with the octuplets.

Arnie Pye,True,False,False,False,False,1,Castellaneta,128,"Arnold William ""Arnie"" Pye is a disgruntled, somewhat eccentric helicopter traffic reporter for Springfield’s KBBL-TV (Channel 6). His segments are titled Arnie Pye with Arnie in the Sky. His accent implies that he may have originated from New York or New Jersey. His name is a play on ""Ernie Pyle"", a famous news reporter. He was called Bill Pye in ""Some Enchanted Evening"", and his name is spelled Arnie Pie in some of the Simpsons Comics issues. A running gag is when he is envious of Kent Brockman's TV fame, and argues with him on the air. Arnie Pye is 37 years old.
 He has an apparent dislike of anchorman Kent Brockman, with whom he often gets into arguments on the air, because Kent is a much bigger and luckier star. This hatred of Kent first became apparent when, during a newscast, Arnie tried to throw his shoe at Homer from his helicopter, leading Kent to tell him ""now's not the time"" before Arnie lashed out at him. Arnie then proceeded to respond sarcastically to Kent when asked if the children in the vehicle Homer was driving were safe, claiming he can't see through metal.
 Pye’s helicopter once crashed; he managed ""Tell my wife I love—” before the live feed was lost. The incident was dismissed with a chuckle by the oblivious Brockman. However, he survived and has been seen in several episodes afterward.
 Pye later crashed his helicopter again when he was flying too close to a tornado. He shouted that the worst of all was the fact that Kent Brockman's voice would be the last one he would ever hear, and called him a ""pompous snow monkey"".
 Arnie Pye was also involved in a crash that saw his helicopter stuck on a major road, causing a traffic jam ""as far as this reporter (Arnie Pye) could see"". Luckily, many Stonecutters were able to bypass the traffic jam due a secret tunnel under a nearby bridge. 
 When Kent was demoted to a Weatherman and eventually fired, Arnie briefly became the new head anchor. He briefly took some joy in usurping Kent Brockman as News Anchorman by drawing a ""Kent Stinks"" graffiti on the Weather Map while Kent was broadcasting the weather.
 However, his joy was short-lived when he learned that in addition to Kent Brockman being demoted, the entire station had to suffer a $10,000,000 dollar fine for Kent Brockman's ""shameful swear-nami"", especially when the fine also cost their mascot, Newshound, laser eye surgery to fix his lazy eye.
 Pye hated Brockman even more as a result, and was also present when Kent Brockman was fired from the station for suspected cocaine use. During his stint as News Anchor, he spoke in a deeper, smoother voice, but returned to his normal register when he got excited near the end of the report. (A similar gag was used in a previous episode with Bumblebee Man, who took over Brockman's desk and spoke perfect English as he delivered the news, right until the end.)
 He later temporarily replaced Brockman again, this time as a result of Kent Brockman revealing he lied throughout his news career after someone blew the whistle on him about his claim of serving in Iraq on a late night show. To add insult to injury for his long time rival, Arnie Pye also made sure to broadcast the last words of Brockman's last words and show footage of him being escorted out by security as well as point out his being disgraced. Arnie Pye then stated he will make sure to restore Channel 6's credibility as a result of Brockman's firing, also citing that corporate taxes are too high. He later gave up his seat as news anchor to Kent Brockman after he exposed a genuinely newsworthy report about Krusty the Clown selling tainted candy.
 ""Arnie in the Sky"" is a deliberate zigzag away from the more natural title ""Pye in the Sky,"" a play on words with the expression ""pie in the sky"". Despite this, the segments are commonly referred to as ""Arnie Pye in the Sky"".
 Note: Many of his appearances are brief, background roles. Episodes in which he has an actual role are in bold.

Herbert Powell,True,False,False,False,True,2,stars,129,"Herbert Walter ""Herb"" Powell (born Herbert Walter Simpson, October 16, 1956) is the former owner of Powell Motors in Detroit, Michigan. He is the biological son of Abe Simpson II and a carnival worker named Gaby, as well as the long-lost, seldom-seen paternal half-brother of Abbey and Homer Simpson. Ashamed out of what he did, Abe and Gaby took baby Herb to the Shelbyville Orphanage, where he was adopted by the Powell family.
 It wouldn't be until four decades later that Herb would be contacted by his half-brother Homer Simpson, where he learned who his biological family members were.
 When Herb was introduced, he was a successful but very lonely man. When Herb found out Homer was his long-lost half-brother, he was overjoyed. Upon meeting his Simpsons family for the first time, he made sure they felt right at home. He was very welcoming, charming, and friendly when they arrived and got along great with Marge and the kids. His relationship with Homer started off great but went downhill after the car he designed ruined his company. However, after he gained wealth again after Homer lent him his money, he forgave him and was happy to call Homer his ""brother"", which was what both men had really wanted.
 Herb is an intelligent, ambitious, charismatic, passionate, but also a lonesome person. Unlike his half-brother, he doesn't have a family to share his life with. Whereas Homer wishes he had Herb's wealth and lifestyle, Herb was envious of Homer for having a more complete life with a family. He learns how to love a family from meeting the Simpsons. However, he doesn't have his employees' total respect as he becomes very assertive when it comes to business, but he seems to be pretty optimistic that a man can make a huge success. He also hasn't seemed to inherit the Simpson Gene.
 The product of a short-lived affair between Homer's father, Abraham Simpson, and Gaby, while Abraham was courting Homer's mother, Mona, Herb was adopted by Edward Powell and Mililani Osler. He put himself through Harvard by working odd jobs because his adoptive parents refused to pay for his admission (or may not have been able to afford his college tuition). He then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb was overjoyed to learn that he had a birth family and bonded with his nieces and nephew, and - in his role as CEO - allowed Homer to design a car. However, homer’s car was a failure and it bankrupted the company (now owned by Kumatsu Motors). Herb ended up becoming a street vagrant. He prefers to be called ""Unky Herb"" by Bart and Lisa because he thinks the term ""uncle"" is too formal.
 He briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2,000 (from the power plant, as compensation for making him sterile from radiation), which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie Simpson. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. He then proceeded to pay back the Simpson family the $2,000 but also bought Homer a vibrating chair, Marge a new washer and dryer set, Bart a life membership in the National Rifle Association, Lisa a monthly set of classic novels, and a promise that he will buy something nice for Maggie. Most of all, Herb ends his antipathy towards Homer and is happy to call him his brother once again.
 While far smarter and more successful than most other male Simpsons as well as having a trim figure and full head of hair he still does exhibit signs of the ""Simpson Gene"", although much more hidden.
 Herb does have cameo appearances such as when he appeared in a picture as Homer was listing off family members who needed to lose weight. Homer referred to him as ""my seldom seen half-brother Herb"". He considers wealth in terms of love and family, not money. Danny DeVito voiced Herb again in ""Changing of the Guardian"", when he was heard briefly as a voicemail greeting. It is revealed that he lost his wealth again, although the circumstances behind this misfortune were not explained.
 Herbert Powell made his fame and fortune by making and designing cars at Powell Motors but lost it all after he met his long-lost half-brother Homer Simpson when he asked Homer to make a car of his choice. The car was called ""blunder of the century"", due to the car looking ridiculous and costing $82,000. This sent the company into bankruptcy and Herb to the street. Herb would regain his fame by inventing a baby-talk converter.
 When he was called by Homer, it is revealed in a voicemail that he ended up losing his fortune again, though this time Homer was not at fault.
 Herb's biological parents are Abe Simpson II and Gaby. Abe first met the attractive female dunk tank operator at a traveling carnival, where they were taken with each other. One year later, Abe saw the same woman again at the carnival to find out he had fathered an illegitimate son (Herb) with her. Unmarried and ashamed of himself, Abe and the woman took their infant son to the Shelbyville Orphanage, where he was later adopted by the Powell family. A year later, Abe married Mona and Abe told Mona about what happened at the carnival. When Homer was born, Mona told Abe to never tell Homer about the out-of-wedlock birth. However, Abe had a mild heart attack in his senior years and decided to tell Homer about Herb. If Abe's story about Virgil Simpson is true, then Herb is 1/32 Black.
 Herb has a younger half-brother, Homer, and an older half-sister, Abbey. Abbie is the product of an affair Abe had during World War II. While Abbie is never explicitly called a Simpson, she looks and acts just like a female version of Homer.
 Herb lived at Shelbyville Orphanage. Herb was adopted by Mr. Edward Powell and Mrs. Mililani Osler. Mililani also gave birth to Coco Powell, Wanda Powell, and Carla Powell. Sometime before Herb met Homer, Edward and Mililani told Herb he was adopted, which upset Herb as it left him with no feeling of having a family.
 Herb is voiced by Danny DeVito (""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and ""Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?""). After ""Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?"" Herb does not appear again until ""The Heartbroke Kid"" where you can see a picture him, then again in ""Changing of the Guardian"" where he is voiced again by DeVito (single line).
 His voice Actor Danny DeVito is unlikely to return, so Herb's future appearances are currently unknown.

Mona Simpson,False,False,False,True,False,1,Hayden,130,"Mona Penelope Simpson (née Olsen), also known as Sunny, and formerly Penelope Olsen, was the mother of Homer Simpson, mother-in-law of Marge Simpson, paternal grandmother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson and first wife of Abraham Simpson II.
 Mona was strong-willed, righteous and caring, always doing what she knew or thought was the right thing no matter what. She cherished the relationship she had with her son and later her grandchildren and daughter-in-law. Despite her friendly nature, she was shown to hold distaste for her ex-husband and Homer's father Abe due to his irritability, intolerance and questionable parenting methods concerning their son, even berating him for telling Homer she had died. She also disapproved of those with ill intentions, as seen when she joined a radical group protesting biological warfare experiments and other unscrupulous activities by Charles Montgomery Burns.
 Overall, she seemed to bring out a more vulnerable side of Homer reminiscent of the innocent child he was before she left.
 Due to being a fugitive from the law from her 30s onward that used fake identification and aliases, Mona's age was unclear. Various driver's licenses issued in the 1990s gave her date of birth as May 10, 1920 March 15, 1929; May 5, 1931; November 26, 1934; July 18, 1933; and February 27, 1926.
 In the 1950s, she married Abraham Simpson.
 At some point after her marriage she learned that Abe fathered Herbert Powell with a carnival worker named Gaby. Shortly after Homer was born, she made him promise to never talk about the incident at the carnival as she wanted Homer to grow up respecting his father. However, she often found herself looking out for Homer while Abe could not have cared any less due to the circumstances of his conception, much to her dismay.
 Despite her hippie activism, Mona's life was on a floating timeline, and while one episode cited Joe Namath's sideburns during a Super Bowl in the 1960s as the start of her political activism and subsequent disappearance, another episode placed this circa the 1980s to 1990s, about 30 years before the Patriots traded Brady.
 Mona took Homer and Abe to Woodstock, where Homer ended up being influenced by hippies. Unfortunately, her frequent protesting eventually led to Homer developing his eating disorder to cope with her absence. When Homer was either about six or nine, and when Mona was in her early 30s, she and other activists protesting germ research entered a facility owned by Mr. Burns, destroying all the biological warfare experiments and curing Clancy Wiggum of asthma. While escaping, she made the mistake of stopping to tend to Burns who threatened her with arrest. She then left her husband and son; Mona kissed Homer on the head while he was asleep, which Homer thought he dreamed. Abe told Homer that she had died while he was at the movies, although in another episode's flashback Abe told Homer she was dead when she had already been missing for a while. Abe went as far to point out a grave, telling him it was Mona's, although the grave actually belonged to Walt Whitman. A few weeks prior to Mona's departure, Abe took Homer on a fishing trip that ended with Homer nearly drowning, but Abe rescued him and took him back home. This resulted in a brief reconnection between Mona and Abe. Unfortunately, they went back to bickering amongst themselves when Mona revealed she only married Abe to get back at her mother.
 After leaving Springfield, her exact movements are unknown, although it is later revealed she resided at the hippie commune Groovy Grove Natural Farm for several years, painting murals of Homer. She sent Homer care packages each week, although Homer was unaware of this, only collecting the packages many years later (""That's what happens when you don't tip your letter carrier at Christmas""). During this time, she also cheated on Abe, having a ménage a trois relationship at Groovy Grove with Seth and Munchie, who later fondly remembered her as a ""pretty groovy chick"" and ""a demon in the sack"", with Abe humorously remaining oblivious to this fact despite being present during the hippies' reminiscence.  Abe remained unaware of her whereabouts throughout all these past events.
 She was found in Utah by Abe and 16-year-old Homer, but Homer lost her to save Abe. She was the disguised pediatrician for Bart after he was born.
 Homer meets his mother again, after thinking she is dead When Homer faked his own death to avoid work, Mona hears of her son's death on the news and visits her son's still open grave, finding Homer in the grave, who accidentally fell in. She initially told him off for lying in her son's grave until both realized who the other was. She returns to the Simpson house, spending time with Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. She meets Abraham again, although Abraham continues to harbor resentment over her leaving him and Homer. Mona gets angry after learning he had told Homer she was dead although Abraham states to her that he did not want Homer to find out about the fact that she was a wanted criminal on the run for 27 years. While this episode insisted that Homer first discovered Mona was alive after she finds him in his grave a different episode has him learn this when he was 16. When Homer and Mona go to the post office, to collect years worth of care packages, she is spotted and recognized by Burns. Mona is forced again to leave Springfield, on the run from the police, although the now Police Chief, Clancy Wiggum, aides her escape as she had helped cure his asthma.
 Sometime later, Homer discovers a hidden message in a newspaper, left by his mother, to meet her under a bridge. Homer and Bart do so and reunite with Mona, although she is discovered by the police at a diner and is arrested, later put on trial. She is acquitted because of evidence given by Homer, although she is later imprisoned, thanks to Mr. Burns, for signing into a federal park under a false name. Homer attempts to break his mother out of prison on a prison bus, with a police chase ensuing. The chase ends when she apparently dies, after the bus drives off a cliff and into some water, where it explodes, which sets off a rock avalanche, burying the bus. Mona narrowly escapes the bus before it went off the cliff. She again goes on the run, where she sends another hidden message in a newspaper to Homer, written while eating a Rhode Island-style clam chowder.
 Homer, preparing to apologize to Mona, shortly before discovering she is dead. Mona returns to Springfield again, visiting Homer. Homer has grown sick of his mother's constant leaving and returning and refuses to reconcile with her in order to keep himself from feeling hurt. Later, feeling guilty, he attempts to apologize to his mother, only to find out she had passed away sitting in front of the fireplace.
 She is cremated and, sometime after her cremation, the Simpson family watches her recorded will. She leaves Bart her Swiss-army knife, Lisa her rebellious spirit (although Lisa takes her earrings), and Marge an old purse made of hemp, asking Homer to release her ashes from the top of a specific mountain at 3:00 pm. Homer completes his mother's wish, releasing the ashes, which are sucked into a missile launch computer within the mountain, owned by Mr. Charles Montgomery Burns. The ashes stop the missile from launching, preventing the nuclear power plant's waste from being blasted to the Amazon rain forest. Homer is arrested but manages to escape, with help from Marge, Bart and Lisa, destroying the base and fulfilling his mother's final wish.
 Mona continues to live on in Homer's dreams. When Homer develops a bed wetting problem after taking Bart on a fishing trip (which brought back his memory of his disastrous fishing trip with Abe), the rest of the family ventures into his dreams to find the cause of the problem. Eventually, they come across Mona after she saves them, under the guise of Death, from being crushed by a pair of gears. She provides them the answer to Homer's bed wetting problem via movie theater. Mona also tells Homer that he misinterpreted everything that happened between her and Abe after the fishing trip and shows him a video of what really happened. She tells Homer she will always live on in his memory along with younger versions of Homer and Abe. She then tells them to leave the dreams and to wake up, with Homer saying goodbye to his mother one last time. Homer's dream then collapses (due to Jonathan Frink and Clancy Wiggum fighting), and he and the rest of the family return to the real world.
 Mona had straight, light blue hair as well as the distinctive large, round eyes and small, rounded nose typical of Simpson family members. However, in flashbacks she was shown to have dyed her hair maroon.
 Baby Homer and his mother in ""Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Prior to the seventh season, Mona Simpson was mentioned once and only made brief flashback appearances. Homer Simpson first mentions his mother in the Season 1 episode ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"" when he claims she called Homer a disappointment, very contrary to her normal behavior. The first flashback appearance is in the Season 2 episode ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and another flashback appearance in the Season 6 episode ""Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy"" (albeit without her face shown). In both of those episodes, she was voiced by Maggie Roswell.
 Mona's first major appearance was in the seventh season episode ""Mother Simpson,"" which was pitched by Richard Appel, who was desperately trying to think of a story idea and decided that he had to really reach for an idea. He decided to do something about Homer's mother. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. Part of the fun of an episode about Homer's mother for the writers was that they were able to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from.
 The character is named after Richard Appel's wife, whose maiden name is Mona Simpson. Mona Simpson was designed in a way so that she has a little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque.
 The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the far-left revolutionary group Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns.
 Glenn Close, who was directed in her first performance by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say ""D'oh!"" properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.
 Mona was originally voiced by Maggie Roswell, before Glenn Close took over in most of her appearances from season 7's ""Mother Simpson"" to season 33's ""Mothers and Other Strangers"". Tress MacNeille voiced her flashback appearance in the episode ""D'oh-in' in the Wind"", which aired between Close's portrayals of Mona in ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"" and ""My Mother the Carjacker"".
 ""Mother Simpson"" is one of Bill Oakley &amp; Josh Weinstein's favorite episodes, as they feel it is a perfect combination of real emotion, good jokes and an interesting story and they have expressed regret about not submitting it for the Emmy Award in the ""Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)"" category
 IGN.com ranked Glenn Close's two performances as Mona as the 25th best guest star in the show's history. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly called Glenn Close one of ""fourteen guest stars whose standout performances on TV make us wish they'd turn up in a Simpsons Movie 2.""
 Episodes where she has a major role are in bold.

Agnes Skinner,False,False,False,True,False,1,Castellaneta,131,"
In the 1920s, Agnes used to be a wing walker on early planes and performed. Her videos were shown in museums. During the 1950s, Agnes was a pole vaulter and competed during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.  Young Agnes performing as a wing walker When she first appeared as a kindly old woman who embarrassingly called her son ""Spanky"". According to the DVD audio commentary, it is said that her current mean streak can be attributed to the incident involving Bart that took place in that episode in which, while sitting in a restroom stall, Bart caused the toilets to explode. Currently, she is harshly controlling of Seymour, who spends more time with her than his former girlfriend, Edna Krabappel.
 Agnes has exhibited ""cougar"" tendencies in several episodes. Among the younger men, she has been in a relationship (or possibly had sex) with include Superintendent Chalmers, Otto Mann and Comic Book Guy.
 In the episode ""All's Fair in Oven War"" it's revealed that she wears a wig, as she dumps it into Marge's mixing bowl. In the episode ""Ned 'N Edna's Blend"", she asks Seymour if he used her wig glue to patch his shoes again.
 Agnes shares an unhealthy relationship with her son, which often borders on psychosis. Examples include Agnes covering up ""her half of the television"" with cardboard to spite Seymour. When Seymour was out of the house, Agnes phoned him regularly demanding to be taken out of the bath, shielded from the glare of car lights on the street, and other such petty requests. She hid his car keys as a punishment for his talking to a woman on the phone. Seymour himself is very obedient and almost distressingly physically and emotionally close to her (for example, when Edna agreed to marry Seymour, Agnes murmured under her breath ""three in the bed!""). Agnes Skinner's catchphrase is ""Seymour!"" often used to snap her son's attention (as opposed to Superintendent Gary Chalmers's catchphrase, ""SKINNERRRRRR!""). She also uses him as a slave for her own bidding as evident from the quote ""Why couldn't you have died instead of the Car?"".
 Some of Agnes' resentment to Seymour may have derived from even before Seymour was born—during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Agnes competed in the pole-vaulting event while she was nine months pregnant. When Seymour makes his first kick, he hits the bar, thus, making Agnes lose and subsequently crushing her dreams; this is probably why she is so harsh on Seymour.
 Her husband Sheldon Skinner resembles Seymour Skinner. Agnes has also claimed that she was married to three tow truckers. She also briefly dated the Comic Book Guy, before he was arrested for having a secret room full of illegal videos. He asked her if she would wait for him till, he got out of jail, but she refuses, saying that her bones are half dust. She also revealed that she once had an affair with Mr. Burns.
 Agnes Skinner had several affairs with several men, including Comic Book Guy and Gary Chalmers.
 In ""Yellow Subterfuge"", Agnes gets stabbed in the back and dies. However, this was revealed to be a farce staged by Homer and Bart.
 Agnes can be seen with a mustache in Lisa's dream.
 During the second segment, Skinner mentions that his mother hid his car keys as punish him for talking to a woman on the phone.
 Agnes is burned at the stack at the beginning of the final segment due to being a witch, before she dies, she says to her son ""See you in hell, Seymour"". To which Skinner happily say goodbye.
 The death of Agnes Skinner in Treehouse of Horror XI Although, with no continuity Agnes is dropped to her death from many stories up in Treehouse of Horror XI when Homer is attempting a good deed.
 After Jonathan Frink Sr. takes Skinner's spine, Agnes is not amused.
 After she refuses to give Bart, Lisa, Milhouse, and Nelson candy they pull a prank by egging her house.
 During the final segment, Agnes is being transformed into Homer as the virus spreads in the church.
 In the episode ""The Principal and the Pauper"", Agnes' biological son, the real Seymour Skinner (voiced by Martin Sheen), returns to Springfield from war. Agnes, not happy with her new living situation with her biological son, travels to Capital City to take back Armin Tamzarian. She and other Springfieldians, who have grown to like Tamzarian, force the real Seymour Skinner out of Springfield, tying him to a freight train cart headed out of the town. She apparently was displeased with her biological son even before her return, as it was implied that she was fully aware Armin wasn't actually her son, yet played along with Armin's con, even telling him where his bedroom was.
 Prior to The Simpsons Game Agnes went to see a Jersey Boys concert and was sitting in front of Dewey Largo, her hair was blocking his view and later wanted to sue for it.
 Agnes saw the Bullies at the Museum and tried to call 911 but they blocked her number.
 Afterwards she saw Bart and thanked him for putting Seymour in jail, saying he needed more discipline. When Agnes saw some people signing up at the Duff Brewery, she said that they would kill themselves after eating too much.
 Agnes saw Largo with his Lawyer who wanted to sue her, they went to court off-screen. Agnes saw Bart later and said that she wish Seymour helped her win eating Contests. She heard later Mr. Burns in his sleep planning to cut down the trees. Agnes saw Bart later to say that Bart wanted a medal for saving the Trees.
 She later met Snake, Agnes said she didn't have any money Snake then wonders why does everyone always assume that he's gonna rob them Agnes tell him because he's a Professional Criminal.
 Agnes saw the Dolphins attacking Sea Captain at the pier. She went to the Mall then a Alien steals her parking a Spot then Lard lad Appears out of nowhere and steals her purse.
 She thanks Bart for Stopping the Dolphins and says that he Conquered Sideshow Bob but the real hero was a rake. She says that Lard Lad needed a role Model.
 When she is 120, Seymour keeps her living head in a jar in his home with Edna, similar to the heads in a jar shown in Futurama.
 She is seen cryogenically frozen along with other elderly citizens in ""Holidays of Future Passed"".

Snake Jailbird,True,False,False,True,False,2,Azaria,132,"Snake Jailbird is a recidivist criminal, always getting arrested, but rarely being kept locked up for long. His real name has been referred to as either Chester Turley or Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake, and seemingly before his criminal career, he was known as Detention Bird and Professor Jailbird. He speaks with a ""Valley Boy"" accent and has a tattoo of a snake on his arm. He is partial to fast cars and fast women and has a knack for reckless abandon.
 In the Declan Desmond documentary Growing Up Springfield, showing the pasts of Springfield citizens, Snake is called ""Detention Bird"" by a 16-year-old Clancy Wiggum.
 A former student of Middlebury College, Snake referred to himself as ""Professor Jailbird""; it was also revealed that he was formerly an idealistic Indiana Jones-type archaeologist, until Moe stole the Mayan gold coins that Snake had discovered and was going to donate to the museum, so he decided to take his revenge out on society (convenience stores). Snake also has a son named Jeremy.
 It is stated that Snake had previously spent time in a juvenile facility, suggesting he was a criminal before being an archaeologist.
 It is implied by Otto that Snake was the one responsible for ruining Spinal Tap's concert.
 He has stolen cars from Moe, Chief Wiggum, his ex-wife Gloria, Sarah Wiggum, Dr. Nick, Bumblebee Man, Professor Frink, Agnes Skinner, and other characters.
 In an early episode Homer's Triple Bypass the address of Snake's hideout was 742 Evergreen Terrace, before it was established as the Simpson Family's address. It was located next door to Rev. Lovejoy's house and looked considerably different than the Simpson Family home.
 Snakes 1968 Pontiac Firebird 400 Convertible Snake is constantly seen getting arrested but never appearing to stay in prison. He speaks with a ""Valley Boy"" accent and keeps a cigarette pack rolled up in his sleeve. Snake has auburn hair. His occupation is a criminal and a former professor and archaeologist. Snake is partial to fast cars and fast women and has a knack for reckless abandon.
 Snake Patch Snake's car's name is ""Lil' Bandit,"" which is a 1968 Pontiac Firebird 400 Convertible with the license plate GR8 68. It could be a reference to James Dean's so-called possessed car the ""Li'l Bastard."" It also could be a reference to the movie ""Smokey and The Bandit"" which featured a similar Pontiac used to escape police. (but that is a 1978 Firebird Trans Am which is the car Apu drives) It should be noted that the Lil' Bandit's horn plays the opening line of the tune Dixie, similar to The General Lee from the The Dukes of Hazzard.
 Snake has a son named Jeremy, who looks just like him. Snake has custody issues with Jeremy. Although Snake seems to have committed every crime possible, he is an extremely good father to his son. Snake's ex-girlfriend, Gloria, briefly dated Mr. Burns, but then came back to him. Snake and Gloria have been seen together many times and she is pregnant once. He was also implied to have a soft spot for puppies and other animals, as, after being given one of Santa's Little Helper's Poodle/Greyhound puppies, promises to take care of it (albeit in a similar manner to trying to kidnap someone), as well as rubbing it affectionately. His exact views on kids besides his own have varied. Although he once tried to run over Bart in an alleyway during a police sting, he once reacted with horror when, while trying to shoot at Chief Wiggum during a police chase, saw he had Maggie Simpsons in his arms and was noticeably horrified that he had nearly endangered her (as he and Marge accidentally mixed up his gun and Maggie after bumping into each other during said police chase and trying to rush back home in time for Bart and Lisa to come home from school, respectively), and gave Maggie back to Marge while laughing sheepishly with her at the mistake.
 Snake can be seen wearing a Middlebury t-shirt under his trademark vest, suggesting he may be an alumnus. Princeton, however, is the school most often referenced as Snake's alma mater.
 Snake was once held captive by Herman, along with Chief Wiggum, but was eventually rescued by Kirk and Milhouse .
 Snake once ran a telemarketing scam, but could not stick to it, because he didn't like bothering people at home. His reluctance to waste people's time was further highlighted when the subject of a missing dollar bill came up in Springfield, where he asked Bart if the bill he owned had bank teller blood on it, and after Bart stated it did not, he sheepishly apologized for wasting their time before leaving. He also wrote the books, ""The Ten Habits of Highly Successful Criminals"" and ""A Criminal's Guide to Hiding in Mexico.""
 Snake once had a tattoo on his back, saying ""Snake and Gloria 4 Ever,"" but Homer changed it to ""Never"".
 In ""Treehouse of Horror IX"" segment Hell Toupée, Snake was executed based on a ""three-strikes"" policy. First, he burned down an orphanage, then he blew up a bus full of nuns (which Snake declared was ""totally self-defense""), and finally, he smoked in the Kwik-E-Mart. His hair was then implanted into Homer's head, but it had to be removed, due to issues with the hair, instilling Snake-like characteristics into Homer, e.g. seeking revenge for Snake's imprisonment and execution by murdering Bart, etc.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XIV"" segment Frinkenstein although not making a full physical appearance Snake's right arm is one of the parts Frink Sr collects in his rampage to take organs from others to replace his robot parts. Implying Frink Sr either killed him or just simply ripped off his arm off screen but survived (as Comic Book Guy was shown to be alive despite Frink Sr had taken his butt)
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XIII"" Dr. Hibbert's Island segment, he was one of the many people subjected to Hibbert's animal genetics experiments, he was a skunk.
 In the ""Treehouse of Horror XXII"" segment Dial D For Diddly, he tries stealing a painting but is murdered by Ned Flanders who was pretending to be a statue and hurls a sling stone at Snake's head which kills him upon impact and stains the painting behind Snake with splatters of his blood.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XXVI"" segment Wanted: Dead, Then Alive, he is mentioned by Lisa that they tried, convicted, and executed Snake for Bart's murder.
 In the opening for ""Treehouse of Horror XXVII"", he worked as a worker at an ex-con Christmas tree yard, where he helped someone get their Christmas tree into the car, and also blew out one of the windows with a shotgun to give the tree more room to fit. He also appears in the BFF R.I.P segment in prison telling Bart and Lisa to keep it down as he is busy holding Wiggum hostage with a shiv to his neck before stabbing Wiggum in the neck.
 In ""Future-Drama"", he tries to rob Charles Montgomery Burns but is foiled by Bart Simpson.
 
In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", he is a robot trying to rob the Kwik-E-Mart.  Robot Snake Snake occasionally appears as a passenger, and often tells the player he just wants to get out of the area immediately. However, he sometimes directly tells the player where he wants to go. Namely, he states at one point that he wishes to go to 742 Evergreen Terrace in order to loot the house. He can also be unlocked as a playable character, his vehicle is Lil' Bandit. In Mission Mode he used in Mission 5 where the player has to knock over 20 barrels of nuclear waste at the Nuclear Power Plant.
 Snake is first in encountered in Level 2 of the mission ""Weapons of Mass Delinquency"" where he sells illegal fireworks to Bart. Later on in the mission ""Bart 'n' Frink"" he briefly stole a military radio from Herman's Military Antiques (as he thought he'd get bodacious chicks with a military radio), but Bart managed to stop him by challenging him to a race to settle who gets the radio and Snake ends up losing the race (also because Bart convinced him that girls like fast cars not vintage electronics). Snake was later arrested by Chief Wiggum in Level 3 of the mission ""Slithery Sleuthing""  when Lisa helped him uncover evidence of crimes under the three-strikes law (Counterfeit Designer Jeans, running over an elderly citizen without a permit, and littering, in that order) in exchange for information in regards to her missing brother. Later on in Level 5, Apu reluctantly sought for his advice in regards to a potential lead to the source of the contamination of the Buzz Cola, as well as who was involved in contaminating it. Snake agrees to give him all he knows in exchange for Apu helping him do ""community service"" (which involved taking Garbage Pails and, later, destroying an Armored Truck), the second of which he truly gave info after Apu threatened to use profanity. In Level 6 he hosts the bonus mission ""Milking the Pigs"" where Bart has to steal the evidence Wiggum is keeping for Snake's trial from his police car and then destroy a milk truck (as he claims Fat Tony is paying big bucks for every milk truck that gets destroyed) beating the bonus mission unlocks his car ""Lil' Bandit"". His last appearance was in Level 7 when Homer ended up carjacking Snake (to which he notes the irony that he is the one getting carjacked), and ends up agreeing in order to not see Homer flip the bird at him. He survives the destruction of his car (he is seen to have jumped out). His car contained nuclear waste, and it was pulled into the Rigellians Tractor Beam.
 He sometimes appears in the back area inside of the Kwik-E-Mart as a background gag where he is seen mugging Hans Moleman.
 On the main menu screen he is one of several characters that appears and passes by the sitting room window. He is seen dropping from a height implying he had just dropped off the roof of the house after successfully or unsuccessfully committing a burglary on it, quickly looks through the window to check that nobody has seen him and then runs off.
 His voice is also heard at the beginning of the game, where he announces the name of ""Radical Entertainment"" in his usual manner.
 When the new Itchy and Scratchy game comes out, the entire Police Department is distracted and Snake thinks it will be a good chance for him to escape on his way to rob an orphanage, but is caught.
 Snake appears in a jail cell in the level Mob Rules, who can be busted out and can join Marge's mob to ironically protest the sale of a violent video game.
 Later during the Alien Invasion, Snake is seen talking to Agnes Skinner who assumes he's going to rob her which Snake doesn't get and asks why everyone assumes he is going to rob them. Agnes says it is because he is a criminal.
 Snake appeared as the Serpent during the first segment detailing Adam and Eve, where he tempts Adam (played by Homer) and Eve (portrayed by Marge). Although Marge is unwilling to eat the apple, Homer eats several.

Cletus Spuckler,True,False,False,True,False,5,Azaria,133,"Cletus Delroy Montfort DeMontblanc Bigglesworth Spuckler, also known as Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel, is a stereotypical redneck with a good-natured personality. He is thin and is usually portrayed wearing a pair of jeans and an undershirt. He resides with his family on Rural Route 9 in Springfield. He is sister and wife to Brandine Spuckler, and it is heavily implied throughout the series that they are in some way related (possibly brother and sister), and having their children together makes the two consanguinamorous.
 Growing up, Cletus developed a loving relationship with his mother, whom he addresses as 'Maw.' He has always been social and hard working. Cletus isn't bothered by others' opinions of him. He isn't ashamed by his marriage to his apparent relative, Brandine Spuckler. Cletus has several hobbies which include whittling ""piney babies"" for children, searching for roadkill, digging through garbage, and spending time with everyone in his family except Brandine. He admits his favourite food is fresh skunk and raccoon. Cletus had a ""smell-hound"" named Geech, although the latter ended up killed in an accident involving a cement mixer, much to his supervisor Bob Terwilliger's chagrin.
 Cletus has seemed to be suffering from some sort of illness caused by drinking mercury out of a thermometer. It badly affected his memory. He whittles what he observes into wood with a penknife. Chief Wiggum was able to track down Bart and Gina after they escaped from the Juvenile Correctional Facility through Cletus' wood carving of them. Cletus also possesses a form of precognitive vision through whittling. He predicted that Chief Wiggum would be mauled by a bear later in that episode. He and his family once abducted a UPS deliveryman and locked him in their Root Cellar due to being under the mistaken impression that the latter was an alien and went to see Cosmic Wars: The Gathering Shadow to identify which alien he was and showed a photo of the postal worker to the ticket person.
 Cletus and Brandine have a happy relationship, however they are often shown having disagreements. Cletus had an apparent stronger love to a pig, rather than Brandine. At one time, Brandine wielded a shotgun at him for giving the pig ""a day of beauty and make-up"" instead of herself.
 Cletus and Brandine were once rejected from coming to Lenny's party after they both claimed to be afraid to use the ""uppity box"" (an elevator).
 Cletus works as a fifth-generation dirt farmer. He also owns a successful chain of moonshine stills and was delighted when it was decided that his drink would be used to flavor the latest version of Southern Cracker. He and Brandine operate a vegetable shack near the Kwik-E-Mart. He is currently in the process of opening a family business that sells miscellaneous animal parts. Cletus took advantage of the money his children were making and used it to his own personal satisfaction.
 During Trappuccino, Cletus distracts Cargill while the town escapes through a hole in the top of the dome, only to be knocked off by Homer attempting to get into the dome (surprisingly, he was actually able to succeed at distracting him, at least before Homer entered, a fact that Cargill was repulsed and embarrassed of), with Cletus largely sympathizing with Cargill due to Cletus himself having lost a game of Tic-Tac-Toe to a chicken before then.
 Cletus dresses in a sleeveless tattered white shirt and blue pants. He also has a snake tattoo on his arm. Snake has the same tattoo.
 His theme song implies that he has lost at least one of his toes.
 Cletus with his sister/wife Brandine Cletus has an ongoing relationship with Brandine, who is generally represented as his wife, although the nature of their exact relationship is somewhat vague. It is often implied that the two are siblings. At an auto racing event, Brandine remarks ""Dang, Cletus! Why'd you have to park so close to my parents?"" to which Cletus responds, ""Now honey, they's mah parents too!"" However, he may mean that they are his in-laws (This plays into the stereotype that incest is prevalent among hillbillies).
 Homer, who was ordained over the Internet as a minister, was once preparing to marry Cletus and Brandine. Looking at a form, he asked ""Wait a minute… are you two brother and sister?"" Brandine replied, ""We's all kindsa thangs ."" To complicate the issue further, Brandine remarked to Cletus ""Yer tha best husband, brother I ever did have..""
 If all this is correct, it is to be assumed that ""Maw"" is his stepmother and Brandine is his natural mother, his father being Brandine's father, making him her half-brother and son.
 Further confusing matters, one of Cletus' sons creates a hand-drawn family tree. According to this diagram, Brandine is the child of Cletus and an alien. Cletus and Brandine have thirty-nine children, which include a sheep and a walking hot dog.
 Cletus has also said to Brandine ""of all the cousins I could've married, you was my sister.""
 Cletus with some of his children He seems to be the father of a large number of children, 44 to be exact. When he presents Marge with 300 coupons for free pretzels from her pretzel business, he calls out to his children: Tiffany, Heather, Cody, Dylan, Dermot, Jordan, Taylor, Brittany, Wesley, Rumor, Scout, Cassidy, Zoe, Chloe, Max, Hunter, Kendall, Kaitlin, Noah, Sasha, Morgan, Kyra, Ian, Lauren, Qbert, and Phil. Cletus and Brandine also have a daughter named Condoleezza Marie, who was somehow switched with a bag of sugar that Homer was carrying as part of a parenting exercise, and a daughter named Rubella Scabies, whose middle name was inspired by a word spelled by Lisa in her audition for the annual spelling bee. They have another daughter, Gummy Sue.
 When Brandine tests Moe's drink, it is seen she has a card saying ""19 children"".
 Lisa encounters Cletus gathering up roadkill for a hillbilly wedding feast. In the short dialogue that ensues it is implied that Brandine is giving birth to yet another child in the truck's cab.
 The children's names seem to mock the pretentiousness that celebrities have in giving their own children ""cute"", unorthodox, or non-traditional names.
 Lisa once tutored seven of the Spuckler children, named Birthday, Crystal Meth, Dubya, Incest, International Harvester, Jitney and Whitney. However, Brandine reveals that Cletus is the father of only two of these children (casting doubt on the paternity of the other children of the Spuckler household). Brandine was once seen to give birth in a car, apparently with very little pain, and asking Cletus to cut the ""umbrellical cord"". After one of his children, Carl, is accused by Homer of cheating at soccer, Cletus says of his children, ""I have sired a dumb-dumb, a mush-head, a whatsit, a dogboy, and something with a human face and fish body what we called Kevin. But my young'uns is not dirty players!""
 One of their daughters, Mary Wrestlemania Spuckler, who is supposed to be married to Bart. Cletus mentions that they ""name all their kids after what they think is gonna happen to them. Ain't that right, 'Stabbed In Jail'?"" to which Stabbed In Jail Spuckler (who is seen sharpening a wooden stick) replies, ""We'll see who stabs who.""
 Brandine refers to him as Cletus Del Roy Spuckler, implying that Del Roy is his middle name and Spuckler is his last name. Cletus signs this as his name in surprisingly elegant cursive to Marge's petition to ban sugar from Springfield.
 Vice-President Cletus At age 43, he is the Vice President of the United States. He attends the funeral of the Sultan of Brunei.
 He was shown for Freaks, No Geeks having Brandine beheaded with him.
 In a ""Treehouse of Horror"" issue of Simpsons Comics, Brandine (off-panel) is attempting to give birth to a child to completely fill out a set of Seven Dwarfs costumes. In Simpsons Comic #113, It is revealed that Homer and Cletus are cousins twice removed, which partly explained their similar dress code of white shirts and blue pants, and their lazy personality.
 Cletus appears as both a driver and a potential passenger. He appears in varying roles in the various levels:
 In Level 1, he acts as the bonus mission: Homer wanted to borrow his pickup truck, but Cletus refused, as he needed to do chores before he can have Rat-pie. After Homer offers to do the chores for him, he then has Homer pick up some cardboard tubes from the gas station so he could create cardboard plumbing, and then have Homer knock down various tomacco plants and deliver them to him so he and his kids can prepare them for market, offering to take Homer anywhere he needed to in return. After Homer did them, true to his word, Cletus told him to use a phone booth (which he referred to as them magic talk boxes) to have him come ""a-running.""
 In Level 2's fourth mission, ""Better than Beef"", Bart came to him to request for his satellite antenna (which he needed to help Professor Frink with his latest project). Cletus then agreed to let Bart have it... under one condition: Namely, Bart help him retrieve road kill so he could sell them to Krusty Burger (which explained the tiretracks Bart noticed on each burger). Bart aided him in doing so, as well as avoiding Apu (who didn't tolerate competition regarding selling rotten meat). According to Cletus, the satellite antenna included 14 channel, including the Outhouse channel (which was apparently Cletus's favorite).
 In Level 3's third mission, ""Bonfire of the Manatees"", Cletus appeared again, this time as an antagonist, where Lisa, in exchange for Apu giving her any information or leads regarding her then-missing brother, Bart, aided Apu in trying to retrieve roadkill from Cletus that the latter was about to sell to Krusty Burger (it is heavily implied that Apu largely did this as revenge for Cletus successfully selling rotted meat and thus being competition).
 Cletus also appeared in the 2nd and 3rd missions of Level 4, as an antagonist and an ally, respectively. In the former, ""Redneck Roundup"", Marge approached his house in an attempt to question him about a crop-circle that appeared in his Tomacco field. However, when she arrived at the house, Cletus, before Marge could even ask, angrily told her that, regardless of whether she was from New York, he's not letting her take pictures of his ""de-craft-itude"" for any magazine (implying that he was the subject of a media circus because of the crop circle and wanted to get away from it), and left before he could hear Marge's side of the story, thus forcing her to pursue Cletus as well as retrieve any belongings that fell off of his truck. Eventually, they convened at a gas station. In the latter mission, Ketchup Logic, Cletus, apologizing for his earlier behavior upon learning that Marge only wanted the information on crop circles to help her addled son, Bart, then apologized for his earlier behavior, as he believed her to simply be a ""city-slicker."" However, he still refused to help her unless she helps him out first: Namely, he wants her to help out with the harvest, with Marge obliging, although not before changing into her old prison uniform to ensure her regular outfit didn't end up stained. He then told her they need to retrieve discarded ketchup packets to ensure that he and his family survived through the long winter. Upon their doing so, Cletus then told her as much as he could tell her about the crop drawings, though it wasn't much: His grand-pappy once saw them, though he was already dead by this time and thus couldn't give her any information. He does, however, tell her that old people most likely knew about them, and try asking anyone around the graveyard. It is also implied that Cletus may be of Muslim or at least Arabic descent, as when he mentioned his grandfather's current deceased status, he mentioned that he ""was with Allah now.""
 His voice is also heard in Level 7's first mission, ""Rigor Motors"", where he is heard yelling at Homer to give back the boards as he needs them to sleep before moaning in disappointment (as Homer stole them to board up his home).
 Cletus appears in the level Invasion of the Yokel-Snatchers as an alien abduction victim who at that time was going to purchase a flat-screen HDTV at the Springfield Mall. He also appears in Mob Rules as one of the people Marge can use to protest the sales of the Grand Theft Scratchy game to minors.
 Note: Cletus called the HDTV a ""flat-screen magic picture machine""
 Cletus' first name came from writer Jeff Martin's boyhood little league baseball coach in Houston, Texas.
 Cletus was introduced during the fifth season in ""Bart Gets an Elephant"". He is shown as one of the ""slack-jawed yokels"" gawking at Bart's elephant Stampy. Cletus' voice is slightly deeper in this initial appearance than in later episodes. He, like the Sea Captain before him, was the go-to character for a quick laugh on the show, and is a staff favorite. He was introduced as a character in ""22 Short Films About Springfield"". The episode featured bluegrass music played on a banjo accompanied with different taglines stating the abnormal things Cletus has done including eating a skunk and losing a toe.

Brandine Spuckler,False,False,False,True,False,7,MacNeille,134,"Brandine Spuckler is the sister and wife of Cletus Spuckler. She is a stereotypical hillbilly, who mothers she and her husband/brother's countless Spuckler Children on an old, run-down farm on Rural Route 9.
 Brandine is a dumb, redneck, hillbilly and overall, basically a female version of Cletus. She is also known to have many disabilities. She has suffered from rabies and admitted to being illiterate, as seen when she couldn't write her own name during a cooking contest.
 Brandine and Cletus are both stereotypical representatives of hillbillies. Brandine is also 41 years old.
 They are oft insinuated to be related, alternately as siblings, each other's parents
 In ""The Italian Bob"" she said to Cletus, ""You are the most wonderful brother and husband, I ever had"".
 In ""Alone Again, Natura-Diddily"" when she complained that they should kiss in front of her parents and Cletus said, ""They's my parents, too.""
 In ""Love Is in the N2-O2-Ar-CO2-Ne-He-CH4"" after shooting down a cherub and Brandine assuring Cletus she can fry up whatever he can shoot down, he says ""Oh Brandine, of all the cousins I could have married, you was my sister"".
 She has 60 children. There were originally 26 that Marge saw and several more were later seen. Cletus is apparently only the father of two children (""The one who can't sing and the one who can't adlib""), despite most of them resembling both parents in appearance.
 When Brandine tests Moe's drink, it is seen she has a card saying ""19 children"".
 Brandine is also the ""Mother"" type of mother you meet at the PTA.
 She once interviewed for a job as a stripper, although she refused to wear the combat boots that her husband had found, stating she did not want to scuff the topless dancing runway. She, along with Cletus, is claustrophobic and won't go up elevators. She also has apparently worked at Dairy Queen at some point, which she referenced in refusing to wear a shirt Cletus gave her, citing she had to wear “the shirt what Dairy Queen give me.” It was shown that Brandine was in Iraq, fighting in the Iraq War. She came back to stop Cletus’ exploitation of their children, and to tell him that he was only the father of the two untalented kids, casting doubt over the paternity of the other Spuckler children. She once was briefly under consideration as a foster mother to the Simpson children.

Squeaky-Voiced Teen,True,False,False,False,False,2,Castellaneta,135,"He is often seen working in a Krusty Burger and has also worked for the Grocery Store and the Aztec Theater.
 He was once an employee at the Mom &amp; Pop Hardware store to try and get with ""Mom"", him being ""Pop"". He also worked at Barney's Bowlarama, where it was revealed that his mother was Lunch Lady Doris. He was also employed at Book Returns and Moe's Express. A rudimentary version of the character was employed at the Springfield public access television station (see ""Homer Badman"" episode).
 He was in a managerial position at a shoe store, employing Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney.
 Furthermore, he worked at a Mexican restaurant called The Brown Burrito, in which he wore a name tag bearing the name Steve.
 He once tried to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, because FOX cancelled Futurama. He landed in a car, in which two teens were making out, crushing one of them. The attractive girl, shocked he crushed her boyfriend, assumed he must be awesomely good at love-making and immediately proceeded to make out with him.
 He was also in a relationship with Mom, an employee at the Mom &amp; Pop Hardware store.
 When Lindsey Naegle once suggested they ""kill every child... friendly thing in town"", he lost his squeaky voice to ""become a man"".
 Little is known about Jeremy's family, and it is very rarely ever discussed in episodes. However, we know that his mother is Doris Freedman, who has disowned him, and he has worked in her cafeteria before. It is unclear if Doris truly disowned him or just said this as she was upset at not being able to get a lane to bowl.
 He also has an unseen Catholic aunt mentioned in the comics.
 Seymour Skinner refers to the character as ""Jeremy"" in a deleted scene on The Complete Fifth Season DVD. In ""G.I. D'oh"" where the bullies Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney work at a shoe store, they refer to him as Mr. Freedman.
 In ""Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"", Abraham Simpson refers to him as ""Mr. Peterson"", Peterson being his mom's maiden name.
 Jeremy appears briefly in The Simpsons Ride, a theme park attraction in Universal Studios Hollywood and Orlando. He complains that the audience needs to keep quiet while he studies for a math test and aims to get a C. In the episode: ""Beware My Cheating Bart"" he has a nameplate that shows his name is Steve.

Drederick Tatum,True,False,False,True,False,2,Azaria,137,"Tapped Out 'Boxing Drederick Tatum' Drederick Earl Tatum is a former boxer who resides in Springfield. Heavily based on Mike Tyson, Tatum is known for his extremely large size, his success at boxing (former Olympian and World Heavyweight Champion), his ever-present lisp, and a long and troubled history of violent outbursts and incidents. He seems to have retired from boxing in recent years.
 Drederick Tatum was a former Olympic Gold medalist, first became World Heavyweight Champion after defeating Watson in the heavily promoted ""Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out!"" He grew up in Springfield, recalling that that town was a dump (since he once said this: ""If you ever see me there again you'll know I really -up bad""). He later served time in prison after pushing his mother down the stairs.
 While serving time in prison, he was apparently intimidating to the other prisoners and guards, as evidenced by the fact that he managed to quell a prison riot simply by saying ""Hey guys, come on! Shut up!"" without even leaving his cell. In a parole hearing, he admits he has regrets about pushing his mother down the stairs, and if he had an opportunity to go back in time, he'd ""certainly reconsider it"".
 Upon his release, he was booked for a match against Homer, during Homer's brief stint as a boxer who had never been knocked out. Drederick was managed during this time by Lucius Sweet, a vicious boxing promoter. Tatum stated that he thought Homer Simpson, his opponent, was a good man, although he still planned to make orphans of his children. Drederick dominated the majority of the fight and even had time to stop during the first round to talk to Charlie Sheen. He was winning in the first round when Moe flew in through the top of the stadium and saved Homer meaning that he lost via abandonment. During the match, he didn't seem upset at all that Homer was saved by Moe by the latter airlifting him out of the ring, and in fact expressed that it showed how much Moe cared for Homer as his promoter.
 He also visited the school to make a speech; during which Lisa used him to test her hypothesis that bullies tend to attack nerds due to a certain chemical in their sweat; Lisa's hypothesis proved to be true as Nelson reacted unwillingly but instinctively to the chemical by trying to punch Tatum, who only calmly warned him to stop or he would kick him.
 He was also a friend of Carl (they met at a party held by Dr. Hibbert), which proved beneficial to have Homer help Marge train in the mixed fighting tournament to end it. His house also has a few exotic animals.

Ralph Wiggum,True,False,False,False,True,1,Hayden,138,"Ralph Wiggum is a major character in The Simpsons. He is the son of Chief Wiggum and Sarah Wiggum and a student at Springfield Elementary School. Ralph is a well-meaning boy who suffers from either severe learning and social disabilities, and/or some other form of childhood psychiatric disorder. The nature of his mentality is kept rather ambiguous, much like many of the signature traits of much of the show's cast. Like almost every other character in Springfield, he may not be quite as simple as he first seems, as evidenced by his hinted immense potential as a performer in ""I Love Lisa"".
 Ralph Wiggum is an oddball student at Springfield Elementary School. He is best known as the Springfield's resident oddball and has been acknowledged for his non-sequitur and erratic behavior. His lines range from purely nonsensical, unusual interpretations of a current event to surprisingly profound statements that go over people's heads. In ""Lisa's Pony"", he is strangely depicted as intelligent and poetic, while in ''El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)"" he was the one who stopped Homer from drinking candle wax by accident, which led to Homer doing so on purpose in an attempt at gaining a protective coating for a certain spicy pepper. It was revealed in ""Moms I'd Like to Forget"" that this was because his dad dropped him on his head when he was a baby. For this, Ralph is somewhat of an outcast among his peers, although he seems to be on good terms with a fair number of the other kids at school, such as Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse.
 Ralph is quite an enigma of a child. Upon first glance, one might mistake him for a child with dementia, or, perhaps, they might even look at him as mentally challenged. What is definite, however, is that he can't help it, as evidenced by his apparently slow grasp of things in the world around him, his difficulty in studying, and his sporadic speech impediments. It is shown in ""Moms I'd Like to Forget"" that he was a normal, well-functioning baby until he was accidentally dropped on his head by his father. His unique manner of speech is often the source of the character's trademark quotes, where Ralph may make a comment such as ""What's a battle?"", ""It tastes like... burning!"", or ""Mr. Flanders, you're blindeded!,"" as well as his tendency to call his teacher ""School Mommy"", which they respond to rolling their eyes, and on one occasion calling Superintendent Chalmers ""Super Nintendo Chalmers."" He appears to have several talents. He is an incredible tap dancer and played the role of George Washington in the school play. Like Washington, he not only recited his lines perfectly, but also managed to play the role so well that he brought the audience to tears. In Season 2 (or Season 3), he seems be having less speech impediments and learning disabilities. Ralph is in his first year of second grade and also shown to be able to drive his father's police cruiser.
 Ralph is often seen in very awkward situations such as eating paste, crayons, worms, clay, knobs, lamps, and the Easter bunny; other such erratic forms of behavior that have since become a staple of the character. Ralph has a rather immense imagination and is seemingly oblivious to the world around him. As such, he is generally a cheerful boy. However, Ralph also has a hint of tragedy and dark satire to him, like most characters on the show. Throughout the show's history, Ralph is eternally the odd one out among his peers at school. He has connections because his father is Chief of Police. Ralph seems to generally get along with many people, as well as occasionally irritating and baffling them. After Lisa gave him a Valentine out of pity, Ralph developed a crush on her. Lisa publicly reveals the true reason she gave him a Valentine and never really liked him, leaving Ralph devastated. The pair eventually become friends and Lisa has generally been nice towards him since. Bart is, however, a long sufferer of Ralph. On one occasion, Bart is forced by his mother, Marge, to play with Ralph. He is at first bored with Ralph but ends up having fun after they steal Clancy Wiggum's master key to the city, and Bart eventually admits that Ralph is his friend. He is also Bart's ""last resource"" friend for when nobody else would spend time with him. Ralph's relationship with his parents seems to be loving and affectionate. Clancy, in particular, rather adores his son as the two do much together, such as various road trips or Ralph's first trip to a major league baseball game.
Ralph can be quite a handful, however, and there are times where Clancy can be neglectful of his son as well. His favorite food is school supplies. Ralph has a multitude of imaginary friends such as Wiggle Puppy and a pyromaniacal leprechaun being particularly well-known among viewers, which tells him to ""burn things."" Ralph's teacher, Miss Hoover, is indifferent to his personality and his imagination; and though she will often correct him in a dull, condescending manner (""The children are right to laugh at you, Ralph,"" she tells him at one point) she has yet to outright scold him. This could be because, as he told his father, she is ""tired of trying,"" as he usually misses the point.
 Ralph once signed up for the Auntie Ovenfresh Bakeoff, but his Grilled crayon sandwich with thumbtacks was rejected by the contest (We can kind of see why.)
 Ralph was also part of a rather infamous hoax where Homer, Skinner, Apu, Lenny, Carl, Chief Wiggum and others had become so fed-up with the entire issue of voting early for the election that they decided to cast all of their votes to someone who was not only unbelievably small but also so young and unbelievably unintelligent it would be impossible for him to be considered a candidate (and they ultimately chose Ralph). Ironically, Lisa discovers that Ralph is not only aware of what being nominated means, but is also taking the idea of being elected very seriously. Using his childish behavior, he intentionally manipulated the Republican and Democratic parties to join forces in their support of him. Ralph Wiggum is best at sleeping and acting.
 During class, Ralph's teacher Miss Hoover will stop lecturing the class for a moment to question Ralph's actions such as eating something he shouldn't, or saying something bizarre or oblivious. Another common Ralph moment is him being at a major event, and saying something to either perplex everyone present with its insight, or point out something so glaringly obvious it's funny. Ralph has quite a knack for getting himself into sticky situations as well. Examples of Ralph moments include him gorging himself with chocolate, being profiled by a scary dentist, pretending to be a firetruck, saying that he is afraid of chicken legs, pretending he is an imaginary puppy (see ""This Little Wiggy""). When Bart was skateboarding naked, saying ""I like men now"", and proclaiming that he will attend ""Bovine University"". He has been shown wetting himself in public. Similarly, in the future, he can be seen talking to a classmate by the punch bowl, saying ""I can use the potty now."" At one point, during a contest for children regarding making a future Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, after Mr. Burns bluntly told him ""Thank you, get out!"" when Ralph's ""project"" (which was a Malibu dream house with the word ""nuclear power plant"" replacing dream house), he stood at the stage blankly staring at the present audience, and only moved to get off the stage with his project after his father yelled from the crowd ""Uh, Ralphie? Get off the stage, sweetheart!"" Also, in a moment when Skinner was looking at the building sadly and remembering touching moments with kids saying things like ""I know how to read"" and ""thank you, Principal Skinner,"" Ralph's distinctive voice saying ""Principal Skinner, I got carsick in your office"", is heard. His usual traits were also referenced in the cover of an article for TV-Guide, where Ralph Wiggum was the only one to remain focused on smiling for a group photograph with most of Springfield's cast when the others, even his father, ended up distracted by Bart Simpson streaking past the group. His abnormal behavior was prevalent and apparent enough that Bart -when attempting to report to the Counter Truancy Unit about his progress in investigating Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney's whereabouts- referred to Ralph as ""a very special boy."" In addition, he also spoke unintelligibly when suggesting to Bart how to get a baby brother.This particular instance was a reference to Kenny from South Park, due to Ralph wearing his attire as well as him being run over by Otto by accident. This seems to have subsided a little recently, although appearances by Ralph himself have been lighter. Ralph has also demonstrated signs at being borderline psychotic, as he has stated that there is a rock in his yard, where he saw a leprechaun, who told him to burn things. When he later helps save the Mayor of Springfield with Bart and Lisa, the leprechaun appears and tells him, ""You've done grand laddie. Now you know what you have to do? Burn the house down! Burn them all!"" with Ralph smiling vacantly and nodding in agreement.If you call Chief Wiggum, a recorded message of ""If something is stuck IN Ralph, press 1. If RALPH is stuck IN something, press 2. If this IS Ralph, Daddy is not in the phone, so don't open the phone looking for me"" will be heard.
 Ralph with Bart Simpson Ralph has been shown with different children frequently. On one occasion, Bart stood up for him to the bullies and befriended him; but most of the time he isn't bullied, it is perhaps because he is so completely harmless, or alternatively because he is the son of the Chief of Police. He is more commonly shown with the rest of the second grade class; rolling down hills and climbing trees.
 Lisa is also one of Ralph's friends, and was once his so-called girlfriend, but that ended when Lisa said that she didn't really love him. Ralph asks Lisa for test answers now.
 Ralph Wiggum bullies Hans Moleman and Miss Hoover bullies Ralph Wiggum.
 Ralph has had many romances throughout the series. In ""I Love Lisa"", Ralph develops a crush on Lisa Simpson after she gives him a Valentine. Later, Lisa publicly snaps; telling him that she only gave him a Valentine out of pity and in the end they are just friends. In ""See Homer Run"", he is seen with Terri, playing with her and Lewis in a swimming suit with a water cannon in mid June.
 Ralph also ""came out"" during The Simpsons Movie after seeing Bart riding his skateboard naked; however, this was not followed up since his understanding of everything is questionable.
 Ralph became a candidate for President after a complicated series of events. After Homer leaves work, and when he is reminded that his diet is starting on the first day of the month (which is that day), he decides to have one last binge at Springfield's Fast-Food Boulevard. After filling up, he decides to throw away his wrappers and the contents of his car in a trash can outside of a Krusty Burger, tossing away a leaky battery and a lit match. The acid from the leaky battery eats a hole in a gas main, with the lit match igniting the gas and starting a fire which soon causes nearby gas pipes to explode, completely destroying Fast-Food Boulevard.
 At a town hall meeting, the enraged residents of Springfield demand that Fast-Food Boulevard be rebuilt immediately. To fund the reconstruction, a bond measure is proposed. As the next election isn't until June the next year, Mayor Quimby moves it to the upcoming Tuesday, making Springfield's presidential primary the first in the nation. Candidates and reporters head to Springfield when they hear the news.
 The candidates flock to the Simpsons, who are undecided. Their home is filled with people and their yard is covered with reporters; helicopters and news vans surround the lot. When voting day arrives, an angry Homer and other citizens hold a meeting in Moe's Tavern. Homer suggests the people vote for the most ridiculous candidate, whom they choose after Chief Wiggum suggests himself. The same night, Kent Brockman announces an unexpected turn of events; Springfield has rejected all the leading candidates and voted for 8-year-old Ralph Wiggum. He wins the primary, much to the shock of Lisa Simpson.
 Ralph is immediately embraced as the leading candidate; Homer and Bart becoming his fans. Lisa, however, is miserable, as she knows how slow Ralph is. The news report, Headbutt, shows Ralph has no idea of which party's nomination he is seeking. Both the Democratic and Republican parties contend to secure Ralph as their candidate. The leaders of both parties break into Ralph's home, wanting to fight for him. Lisa confronts Ralph amongst the media frenzy, attempting to convince him not to run. Ralph tells Lisa he wants to run so he can bring peace between warring parties and his earnest kind heartedness wins her support. He is proven to be a formidable candidate, and both the Republicans and the Democrats support Ralph for president. They made a political commercial for Ralph, sponsored by both parties. Ralph, however, lost the election.
 During the end credits of ""Simpsorama"", it is shown that Ralph's grave read the years 2006-2017, which started a rumor that he would get killed off in 2017. However, it was later confirmed that this was not the case.
 Ralph Wiggum did actually die at the beginning of the 2019 episode ""E My Sports"", when he drank water from a gutter spout until his body inflated and exploded.
 However, he is inexplicably shown to be alive in the subsequent episode ""Bart vs. Itchy &amp; Scratchy""
 In ""Lisa's Wedding"", he becomes one of Krusty's sideshows but is arrested.
 In ""Future-Drama"", he goes to the senior prom where he tells a girl that he can use the potty now.
 In ""Holidays of Future Passed"", there are many clones of him, including two chiefs, a truck driver and burning clone of him. The first clone told Bart that he died and he was turned into a clone.
 In ""Days of Future Future"", a future version of Ralph appears to be a police officer like his father. Similar to Holidays of Future Passed.
 In ""Mr. Lisa's Opus"", a future version of Ralph is still in the second grade.
 In ""Flanders' Ladder"", Ralph dies at the age of 120 after he is poisoned by his son who would become the new king after his death.
 Ralph Wiggum appears as a potential passenger.
 Ralph Wiggum is a character in the game. He plays a slightly major role in Level 2, where he acted as the third person Bart can buy illegal fireworks from. Based on his comment to Bart just before giving him the fireworks (""My daddy's going to put you in jail, bye!"") and Chief Wiggum proceeding to give chase to Bart with the threat of having Bart serve five life sentences of Community Service for the purchase of illegal fireworks, he may have been used by his father in a sting operation against any potential sales of Illegal Fireworks.
Aside from this, Ralph also appears in every level but the final one as a Springfield DMV referee for street races, always acting as the third one (he is absent from the final level alongside the other two judges because of zombies taking over their positions). Unlike the other judges (Milhouse and Nelson), it was never made clear why he was hired by Selma and Patty Bouvier to act as a judge, although his exchange with Lisa in the third level implies that his father arranged for the two to hire him as punishment for presumably acting out at the hardware store. In the fifth level, both Apu and Ralph implied that they had been involved in an incident where Ralph nearly managed to somehow drown himself in nacho cheese, and that the event was highly prestigious to cause newspaper headlines.
 In the PS3 and 360 versions, Ralph is an enemy in Mob Rules. Ralph later appears along with Rod and Todd Flanders as Hobbit-like children who help Homer and Marge defeat the two-headed dragon in order to get the keycard. He also appears as a holder of one of the three Sparklemon that Homer and Lisa must defeat. At the end of the game, he is seen watching the closing moments of the Simpsons family talking with God, then he sees the player and says ""Daddy... someone's looking at me.""
 In the final segment of ""Treehouse of Horror IV"", Ralph is shown to be a vampire.
 In ""Treehouse of Horror XXIV"", when Bart and Lisa get into argument they lick the global Ralph tells he was going to do it for show and tell.
 In the first segment ""Treehouse of Horror XXV"", Ralph gets stuck in quicksand.
 In the final segment called ""The Last Thanksgiving"", Ralph's bones are eaten by the jelly monster.
 In Ralph's first credited appearance in the show was the episode ""Moaning Lisa"", he was considerably different in both appearance and behavior from his later appearance, although he also briefly appeared in the first episode ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"".
Ralph's signature use as a character in the show is to deliver either an odd bit of behavior or dialogue which either perplexes others or merely gives the audience a quick laugh. Originally intended to be a ""Mini-Homer"", Ralph eventually took on a life of his own. The staff figured that he'd also fit perfectly as the son of Chief Wiggum, a fact made canon in ""I Love Lisa"", (although he is referred to by his last name of Wiggum in ""Kamp Krusty"" before). Ralph was named after comedian Jackie Gleason's character on The Honeymooners Ralph Kramden. Matt Groening considers any lines for Ralph ""really hard to write.""
 Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Ralph (and Bart), raises her eyebrows whenever she performs Ralph's voice.
 With a combination of his popular commentary and his endearingly innocent character, Ralph eventually became one of the show's most popular characters. Ralph's popularity as a character has even spread so far that the rock band The Bloodhound Gang made a song called ""Ralph Wiggum,"" dedicated to the character and comprised solely of some of his most famous quotes for lyrics. The song can be found on their album Hefty Fine. Another band, Trillium Circle has a member named Ralph Wiggum, presumably a pseudonym. Ralph also became a prominent pop-culture figure in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election after the episode ""E. Pluribus Wiggum"" aired on January 6, 2008.
 Show creator Matt Groening has stated that Ralph is one of his personal favorite characters on The Simpsons, and whenever someone asks who writes specific characters (a common misconception about the writing process), writers will most likely take credit for writing for Ralph.
 The character from Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Rowley Jefferson bears similarities to Ralph in terms of appearance and personality.
 Ralph has his own book in the series The Simpsons Library of Wisdom. He also had presidential posters and merchandise for the 2008 election, similar to and based on ""E. Pluribus Wiggum"".
He is the featured character on the Season 13 DVD/Blu-ray box set.

Cecil Terwilliger,True,True,False,False,False,8,stars,140,"Cecil Underdunk Terwilliger is the younger brother of Robert Terwilliger.
 Cecil is the youngest member of the Terwilliger family (if you're not counting Gino or Neil).
 When he was young, Cecil was ignored repeatedly by his parents, and instead compared to Bob, similar to the rest of his life.
 Cecil's dream since childhood was to become Krusty the Clown's sideshow on The Krusty the Clown Show, unaware as to how Krusty would treat him on the show. Cecil spent, according to Bob, ""four years at clown college"", to which Cecil replies, ""I'd thank you not to refer to Princeton that way"". Krusty and the producers of his show rejected Cecil during his audition, as they saw his performance failing. Cecil offered to perform his prepared ""pie-in-the-face take"" before he was ushered off-stage, but this did not change the producers' minds as Cecil lacked the dignity necessary to pull the bit off. It was then that Krusty spotted Robert, standing to the side in a fine suit and looking like he genuinely didn't want to be there. Krusty ordered a pie-in-the-face for him, the resulting impact knocking off Robert's top 
hat and causing his hair to spring up from beneath it, Krusty hired Robert as his sidekick on the spot. Cecil resented and became jealous of his brother. Despite that, he entered the hydroelectricity industry and ""found his true calling"" as a hydrodynamics engineer.
 When Sideshow Bob was released from prison, Cecil hired him to work for his company building a new hydroelectric dam along the river, proudly telling him that he was Springfield's ""Chief Hydrological and Hydrodynamical Engineer"". Cecil's true intentions, however, were to skim money from the dam project's contract, build a poor-quality dam, and frame his brother for the resulting destruction (mainly due to his still being sore about Sideshow Bob getting the part of sideshow on Krusty's show). Cecil's plot was discovered by Bart and Lisa Simpson, although they initially thought it was Sideshow Bob who was guilty until Cecil revealed his true colors. Ultimately, he lost the laundered money in a struggle against Bart. However, he does try to succeed in doing ""the one thing Bob failed to do,"" which is, of course, killing Bart Simpson, albeit in an ironically crude fashion as him throwing Bart off of a cliff, although he hints that he will lie if anyone asks how he did it. This attempt was foiled, ironically by Sideshow Bob. Cecil wasn't done yet, however, so he planned to blow up the dam as well as directly kill Bart and Sideshow Bob by shooting the dynamite stick (Bob had to use the Dynamite as a rope to catch Bart), although Bob and Bart foiled this effort by cutting the detonation charge, nearly killing themselves in the process. Despite Bob's innocence, the brothers were sent to prison, since Chief Wiggum did not believe that Sideshow Bob was innocent, despite testimonies from Bart, Lisa, himself, and Lou.
 Several years later, Cecil, alongside his father Robert Terwilliger Sr. and the rest of his family, conspired with Sideshow Bob to ensure he could kill Bart. To do this, they had Bob fake his death by placing a cocktail drug in him before a hearing, and then manipulate Bart into throwing away what seemed to be ""medication"" for a pre-existing condition. He was also briefly given parole to attend the ""funeral."" However, the Simpson family figured out Sideshow Bob's plan and stopped them, resulting in Cecil having an increased sentence. He was last seen playing cards with his father and nephew while Bob was having a breakdown.

Uter Zorker,True,False,False,False,False,5,DeLisle,141,"Üter Zörker is an obese exchange student from Germany.
 Despite not being fully characterized, and obese, Üter is a good-natured boy. He has a huge passion for eating unhealthy food, especially chocolate and candy, and can often be seen alone eating sweets, both at school and on the school bus. In a Treehouse of Horror segment, he actually ate flavored wax.
 It is an ongoing joke during the series that he is dead, though his death has not been canonically confirmed.
 He is a player on the Kwik-E-Mart Gougers Peewee Hockey League Team. Üter also enjoys flirting with Lisa Simpson and sometimes tries to befriend Bart. He enjoys watching German football and also seems to be a sci-fi enthusiast; as he was seen attending the Bi-Monthly-Science-Fiction-Convention.
 Üter once got left behind on the American Civil War field trip and subsequently went missing, as the class was forced to abandon him when the Civil War re-enactment actors at Fort Springfield were in hot pursuit of the party after busting them for attempting to ""learn for free"". His parents demanded Skinner to inform them of their missing son's whereabouts. However, he has since reappeared in episodes after ""The PTA Disbands"" and before being mentioned in ""Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"", which could be a continuity error. He was once seen stuck in a cobweb in the school air vents. Üter then reappeared some time afterwards.
 It is mentioned that he has a crush on Janey Powell.
 Üter has two parents, and an uncle who is the proud owner of a bubblegum factory in Düsseldorf.
 The name ""Üter"" is a neologism (invention) of the Simpsons world and probably a misconstruction of the German name ""Günther"". He speaks with a thick German accent. The Lederhosen he wears are more typical of Bavaria (As well as southern Tyrol  and parts of Austria for that matter) rather than of Germany as a whole.
 He is one of the few characters that debuted in a Treehouse of Horror series episode to actually be integrated into canon.
 In the German version of the show, he is named ""Uter"", his nationality was changed from German to Swiss and his uncle's bubblegum factory is located in Basel. He speaks Swiss-German and has a characteristic love of chocolate.

Kirk Van Houten,True,False,False,True,False,3,Azaria,142,"Milhouse's Bald Mommy (by Rainier Wolfcastle) Kirk Evelyn Van Houten is the unemployed and depressed husband (and first cousin) of Luann Van Houten and the father of Milhouse Van Houten.  
 He is often viewed with contempt by most citizens of Springfield and is frequently seen as soft and weak-willed, although Kirk has proven that he can be a good person and friend in times of crisis. 
 Kirk served in the U.S. Army and graduated from Gudger College. He worked at his father-in-law's cracker factory, 'Southern Cracker', in middle management, but when Luann left him, he was fired from the factory. According to Luann, Kirk was not a very good provider, and she had to borrow money from her sister or steal clothes from the church donation box. He is of Dutch and Danish descent but favors the former. He bickers with his brother Norbert Van Houten, Milhouse's uncle, about the latter's Danish heritage.
 Kirk's demo tape, ""Can I Borrow a Feeling?"" Kirk's race car bed After the divorce, Kirk was a stereotypical, middle-aged male loser and deadbeat dad, suffering depression after his divorce from Luann. He has been seen with one girlfriend since - Starla Starbeam, a chain-smoking alcoholic who stole his car. Luann got custody of Milhouse when they divorced, but Kirk had visitation rights. Much to his displeasure, Milhouse often addressed him as ""Weekend Dad"". At one point, during the Saint Patrick's Day Parade, due to a drunken Apu Nahasapeemapetilon's urging for all the attendees to ""get naked"", he attempted to strip down, citing that the party was just ""getting started."" However, he wasn't able to do more than take his shirt off before being alerted to Bart Simpson's drunken nature in the parade's most infamous moment. Kirk suffers from the need to cry all the time after his divorce, even in good times. He once cut his foot off to try to get Luann back. After being fired from the Cracker Factory, he struggled to hold down a job. He was once employed as an assistant to the guy who puts fliers under people's windshield wipers. Once, he was implied to have been fired from an unspecified job as a result of his arm being amputated and presumably sewn back on as a result of a failed attempt by the criminal Snake Jailbird trying to decapitate Homer in order to get his car back due to being seen in the unemployment office with his arm in a sling. Kirk also had a job standing on the curb holding a sign directing people to a condo development and worked as a scarecrow protecting a soy-bean crop, which resulted in his eye being gouged by a crow. Since being fired from the cracker company, Kirk seems to be unable to maintain a steady job. He attended Leavelle's Bodyguard Academy and he was also a singer who sold his tapes from the trunk of his car. His song was titled ""Can I Borrow a Feeling"" and the album featured a picture of Kirk on the front in a robe, which he was using in an attempt to be a smoking jacket. He was also unemployed at some point, surviving on alimony payments and unemployment benefits. In the episode ""Days of Wine and D'oh'ses"", Kirk is present at Barney's A.A. meeting. The episode was aired after Kirk and Luann divorced, suggesting that Kirk became an alcoholic after the divorce. 
 He was once arrested for kidnapping. When Bart goes to a concert his parents banned him from, he hides at Kirk's apartment which leads to his arrest. Despite liking the attraction from the ladies outside the prison, he is released when Principal Skinner, Lisa and Alcatraaz find out Bart was lying.

Dr. Velimirovic,True,False,False,False,False,11,Azaria,143,"Dr. Velimirovic is a plastic surgeon who has performed operations on Moe, Marge and Homer. He gave Moe a new face that helped him gain a career as a soap opera star. Later, Marge became worried that Homer would lose interest in her. Manjula recommended that she get a liposuction, so Marge went to Dr. Velimirovic, who agreed to give her the operation. However, due to a mix up, Marge ended up with breast implants, which were intended for one of Mayor Quimby's interns. Dr. Velimirovic tells Marge that she has to wait at least 48-hours before the implants can be safely removed. Marge is at first furious about the mix-up, but later becomes adjusted to them. In the end, however, she decides to have them removed.
 Homer went to Dr. Velimirovic for stomach staples and plastic surgery.
 Dr. Velimirovic speaks with an Eastern European accent. His surname is Serbian. In ""Large Marge"" he exclaims ""great Ceaușescu's ghost,"" implying that he may be Romanian.

Sarah Wiggum,False,True,False,True,False,4,stars,144,"Mummy (by Ralph Wiggum) Sarah Wiggum (née Kanneke) is Clancy Wiggum's gentle and sweet wife and mother of Ralph Wiggum. She is always elated and in a good mood much like her son and even husband and is mainly seen in crowds, charity groups, bake sales, book clubs or with her family. She doesn’t speak all the time, but she acts very similar to both her husband and son combined and is in no way a one dimensional character. It’s clear both Clancy and Ralph can’t function without her, she is the glue that holds the Wiggum family together. Sarah somewhat sounds like her husband, but she has a more nasally southern like voice (except for 4 Episodes)
 In the Season 13 episode, ""Half Decent Proposal"" , It is shown Sarah and Clancy are at High School Prom in the 1970's dancing with each other, indicating they may have met or perhaps dated in High School before their eventual marriage. 
 In the Season 14 episode, ""A Star Is Born Again"" , Clancy mentions she was more beautiful at the dance than the day he met and arrested, she giggles and blushes in reply. He then mentions he only planted the crystal meth on her so she would ""notice"" him, so he has an excuse to arrest her and fall in love with her, despite not doing the crystal meth, any drugs, or any crimes in general. Sarah (according to Clancy) is his ""home force"". At one time, she immediately dials the authorities at Clancy's command as a reference to the old-fashioned operator who had the stereotypical name ""Sarah.""
 In the Season 25 episode, ""Four Regrettings and a Funeral"" , Clancy mentioned to Marge that during Sarah's pregnancy with Ralph, she exclusively listened to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Winston Churchill speeches.
 Sarah has round eyes and normal lashes and wears pink lipstick. She usually wears a light teal (almost white) shirt with rolled up sleeves and collar under a light pinkish-orange dress and wears reddish-orange shoes. She has bluish-purple hair, a normal looking nose, and is about 5'8 feet tall along with being relatively fat, but not as fat as her husband, but she does have a fairly big belly like that of Patty and Selma. In one episode, in the present her hair and body design were changed, and in the same episode during her youth, she was very noticeably thinner. 
 When it’s cold outside, She commonly wears a dark and light blue jacket with a brown dress underneath, and when she is at church or dressing for something fancy, she wears a light pinkish dress under a light teal or light pink jacket and a red bow tie, other times she wears a magenta shirt under an olive green jacket and light brown dress. Specifically during the winter, she has worn a very light green shirt under a purple jacket, light pink gloves and pearl necklace along with an olive green skirt and purplish-pink shoes. Another time, she wore a red coat with a black stripe in the middle, along with a white beanie, scarf, mittens, and brown boots. She has also been seen wearing a red plaid robe.
 Sarah's personality is mainly established by her actions and emotions and not primarily by her talking. She has a mix of characteristics and mannerisms to that of her Husband and Son, such as having a childlike innocence and tendencies, along with being somewhat piggish and dimwitted, but she also has a caring and protective maternal nature as well, with the likes of naivete, kindness, and lovingness, which makes for her being a loyal wife and mother, along with her and her Husband being a perfectly matched couple and functional family compared to some other Springfield families, and is shown consistently how well her and Clancy's marriage is and how much they love each other and care for Ralph. 
 In ""The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"", where various supporting characters get spin-offs, one spin-off (Wiggum, P.I.) has Sarah's marriage to Clancy eventually dissolve and they get a divorce. He gets custody of Ralph and moves to New Orleans.
 In ""Uncut Femmes"", Sarah received a whole and rather forced character retcon and voice change to work with this episodes plot line, she speaks awkwardly and acts very weird in the beginning of the episode when she talks to Marge, and throughout the middle to ending of the episode, she acts differently then she has before as a more ""badass"" rebellious femme fatale prostitute with lesbian mannerisms, similar to mannerisms of Shauna Chalmers compared to being civil and motherly like beforehand, and her past shows her as a jewelry thief along with 2 other girls, and she met Clancy (at the time a security guard and not a cop) during a robbery the girls were doing and Sarah was the distraction of the 3 girls, she ended up falling in love with him while she was distracting and seducing him, despite not intending to actually fall in love in him. 
 This same version of the character would return in ""Poorhouse Rock"", only this time the original design of the character is back, but internally is still in the retconned fashion and still with the ""normal"" sounding voice and prostitute rebellious mannerisms. In ""Lisa the Boy Scout"" her mannerisms are different then her past 2 speaking roles, and are back to her Ralph/Clancy mix mannerisms that are consistent with her pre Retcon and post Retcon non speaking cameos and Pamela Hayden speaking roles. Her emotional aspect is like that of her traits of her original character, and not of the lesbian retconned Megan Mullaly version. Same thing would follow in ""Iron Marge"" where she again acts like her old self pre retcon.
 At the end of ""Flanders' Ladder"", she is shown to be one of the many deceased wives of Ned Flanders.
 The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run, in dialogue by Chief Wiggum, he mentions that Sarah has been asking him to get out of the house to get some fresh air.
 The Simpsons Game, when you talk to Sarah, all she says is 'Clancy' (referring to her husband). This includes when you attack her and when she runs away screaming. Chief Wiggum mentions her during the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge saying that the food was so much better than her cooking.
 Tapped Out, in August 2018, Sarah was added as a Premium Character in a bundle which also contains the Springfield Aquarium. She is one of the 'Alcoholic' characters as her tasks include the hour-task of attending AA Meetings with characters such as Bernice Hibbert and Barney. The Sarah Wiggum/Springfield Aquarium bundle reappeared during the Black Friday 2018 event as one of the prizes inside selected mystery crates.

Wiseguy,True,False,False,False,True,2,Azaria,145,"Raphael (also commonly known as the Sarcastic Clerk, Wiseguy, or Middle-Aged Man) is a recurring background character in The Simpsons - his main purpose is to carry out a job or sell a product that gets a plot rolling. His voice is also often used for loudspeaker announcements.
 Raphael's character model has varied perhaps the most of any recurring character, with hair color, style and mustache all changing despite his distinctive voice. It wasn't until later seasons when the page image became the standard model for when his voice is used. 
 Raphael tends to make dry comments when confronted about the prices or quality of his services. He has even been sarcastic towards Comic Book Guy.
 He has held numerous jobs in Springfield including: garage owner, mail man, taxi driver, gun salesman, giving water to plants, exterminator, and various shop clerks and handymen. He was also seen as a money changer in the First Church of Springfield after it had its makeover. He is seen driving the Krusty glass vans around Evergreen Terrace. He is also seen working alongside Sideshow Mel as a security guard for the Springfield Museum, and attacks Homer and Bart for ""being in serious violation of his authority"" , and has acted as a cameraman for at least one children's show. He acts just like Grover Monster from Sesame Street who has a Job License.
 One of Raphael's jobs Raphael's most common job is as a repo man, of which when he ""accidentally"" hurts Milhouse, he says, ""Ha ha! I love this job!""  However he's frequently seen working in the Noiseland Video Arcade.
 He is usually seen as a balding smoker with gray hair and a gray mustache, and generally appears lean, although there was one instance where he appeared overweight. He usually refers to people as ""boyo"" or ""pally"". In Boy Meets Curl and I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot, he had brown hair, and in the season 4 finale Krusty Gets Kancelled, he had black hair. As some of his nicknames imply, he also is quite sarcastic. He also apparently enjoys low-brow humor as evidenced when Bart easily distracted him with a (false) mention of a bawdy limerick graffitied onto the men's bathroom. He apparently owns a Scottish terrier, as after Homer discarded his pajamas out the window in order to emulate Thomas Edison, he was seen walking said dog breed before sarcastically requesting for Homer to do everyone a favor and ""invent"" underpants.
 His voice is intended to resemble Charles Bronson, as seen when the Simpsons try to travel to Branson, Missouri, but mistakenly end up in Bronson, Missouri, first.
 Sideshow Bob identifies his first name as Raphael.

Rainier Wolfcastle,True,True,False,True,True,2,Shearer,146,"Rainier Luftwaffe Wolfcastle is an Austrian, musclebound action movie star. Wolfcastle is a veteran of many action movies, most notably the McBain series. Wolfcastle began his acting career as early as childhood in Austria, appearing on long TV commercials advertising bratwurst. He owns a Ferrari F40 and a Hummer H1. He was married to Maria Quimby and has one daughter, Greta Wolfcastle, as well as a son, Dieter Wolfcastle.
 Apart from the McBain series, Wolfcastle also played Radioactive Man in an ill-fated live-action film adaptation of the comic book series. Wolfcastle has also ventured into comedic roles; in one episode, he carries Homer in an oversized Snugli for babies, remarking, ""I used it to carry Rob Schneider in the movie My Baby is an Ugly Man.""
 Wolfcastle appears to have political ambitions, as noted by his candidacy for mayor in the recall election of Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby. He is a member of the inner circle of the Springfield Republican Party, along with Mr. Burns, Krusty the Clown, Dr. Hibbert, The Rich Texan, Count Dracula, and Bob Dole. Wolfcastle has campaigned as Republican Mayoral candidate and as a supporter of Sideshow Bob for Mayor; However, he disagrees with his party on the issue of stem cell research (Schwarzenegger is noted as more socially liberal than a majority of Republican politicians on such issues).
 He battles frequently with weight problems, even though trying to pass it off as something he is doing for a role. His films are sometimes critical failures; Jay Sherman introduced Wolfcastle in an interview on his TV show as ""star of the 'reprehensible' McBain movies"", and when seeing one of McBain's films, during the ending, Abe Simpson and Jasper were disgusted enough with it that they threw their popcorn and personally sought the manager of the theater out to demand a refund. Wolfcastle apparently is somewhat blind to sarcasm, as when Sherman, evidently disgusted with the basic premise of Wolfcastle's then-upcoming film McBain: Let's Get Silly, asks him how he sleeps at night in thinly veiled sarcasm, Wolfcastle apparently took his question literally, causing him to answer that he sleeps at night on a pile of money with loads of beautiful women, causing Sherman to sheepishly say ""just asking"", clearly not intending to get an answer-back.
 According to various episodes, Wolfcastle began his acting career as a child in Austria, appearing on long television commercials advertising Fritz Schnackenpfefferhausen bratwurst. At roughly the same time, he began experimenting with bodybuilding, and his physique earned him a starring role in several gay pornography films, shelves of which were seen by Homer during one of Wolfcastle's debt-induced garage sales. He was also the primary actor on advertisements for ""Powersauce Bars""; bars claiming to boost muscle growth, but which were, in fact, a mash of apple cores and Chinese newspapers. He also was allegedly a ""key player in the Hollywood Prostitution scandal."" His daughter Greta dated Bart .
 Rainier Wolfcastle has been a presenter at the Academy Awards, a spokesperson for the Powersauce energy bar, a celebrity judge in radio station KBBL's contest ""How Low Will You Go"" (along with Krusty the Clown and Madeleine Albright), host of a short-lived talk show (""Up Late with McBain"", which even Bart thought was horrible and Lisa laments that it's yet another example of the FOX network airing base and crude programming), and a guest on Inside the Actors Studio with James Lipton (in which he kills Lipton after getting into character as McBain). He also was co-owner of Planet Springfield, along with ""Chuck Norris, Johnny Carson's third wife, and the Russian mafia"".
 Apart from the McBain series, Wolfcastle has also played Radioactive Man in an ill-fated live-action film adaptation of the comic book series. Wolfcastle has also ventured into comedic roles; in one episode, he carries Homer in an oversized Snugli for babies, remarking, ""I used it to carry Rob Schneider in the movie My Baby is an Ugly Man.""
 His other films include Help! My Son's a Nerd (don't laugh, it is not a comedy); Mrs. Mom (a movie based on a Marge Simpson script); Frankenberry: The Movie; I Shoot Your Face; I Shoot Your Face Again, and McBain: Let's Get Silly!, a 90-minute movie consisting of McBain performing stand-up comedy in character (and using automatic weapons on audience members who heckle him), which was said to have cost $80 million to produce. He also had an unnamed film that involved a ""Magic Ticket"" in the plotline that was a bomb, which gave him severe bouts of depression when reminded of it. He blamed the film's failure from script problems that plagued it since the first day of development.
 His biggest mystery is how obvious teutophone can get away with playing an Irishman. Wolfcastle also starred as Mrs. Mom. He claimed that he created this story, but it was originally written by Marge Simpson in season 18, although she didn't complain about the plagiarism as she was content that it was even made. He once joined the army to make recruitment films but was sent off to frontline infantry instead.
 In one of his films he had to play a secret agent undercover has a fat man. This could've been in Undercover Nerd but was more likely McBain in McBain VII or McBain VI: The Final Chapter.
 Wolfcastle appears to have political ambitions, as noted by his candidacy for mayor in the recall election of Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby. He is a member of the inner circle of the Springfield Republican Party which meets at Burns's mansion and includes Burns, Krusty, Dr. Hibbert, Count Dracula, and Bob Dole. He drives a Humvee. Aside from his brief stint of running for mayor in the recall election, he also was briefly seen campaigning for Sideshow Bob for Mayor. He was once the Governor of the state Springfield is in, as shown in the top-left plaque hanging on the Springfield Wall of Fame, identified as ""Movie Star, Former Gov.""
 His lead-in announcer on ""Up Late with McBain"" dresses in a full SS uniform, complete with a Nazi armband and is known as ""Obergruppenfuerher Wolfcastle"" (whether he's actually related to Rainier is never stated). In ""See Homer Run"", in a stump speech he refers to himself as being, among other things a ""...son of a Nazi..."". In ""Today, I Am a Clown"", it is hinted he might be anti-Semitic. When Krusty stated in despair that he was just an anti-Semite rather than a self-loathing Jew due to his technically not being Jewish as a result of failing to take a bar mitzvah, he told Krusty that they had much to discuss. However, the fact that he was present within the Jewish neighborhood and about to enter a building makes this ambiguous.
 His turn-offs are nerds and being washed away in a tide of sulfuric acid.
 Despite his aforementioned involvement in the gay porn industry, Wolfcastle himself may also be anti-gay, as evidenced by his accusing an entire audience of being homosexuals after they booed him for describing Skoey's (Up Late with McBain's band leader) outfit as making him ""look like a homosexual"". It is possible he was actually only a gay for pay actor and not actually gay himself which may explain why he might be anti-gay. Despite this, however, he's very friendly and comfortable when naked around others. In ""The Great Louse Detective"", Wolfcastle notices that Homer's trying to avoid looking at his ""famous Wang"" when they're in a steam room together. In response, Wolfcastle simply laughs and says it's OK if Homer looks since everyone's already seen it in his film Nudist Camp Commandant.

Artie Ziff,True,False,False,False,False,2,stars,147,"Arthur ''Artie'' Ziff is a minor character in the TV show The Simpsons. A former billionaire and Marge Simpson's senior year prom date from high school, he has attempted to get Marge Simpson to dump Homer Simpson for him and often attempts to kiss her.
 With a grossly inflated ego, Artie Ziff is a conceited, obnoxious, arrogant, deranged and manipulative narcissist. In contrast to Homer, he has staggering I.Q. and charisma, but this gave him the selfish sense of self-entitlement that, paired with his uncontrollable obsession with Marge, made him into a demented stalker, and a constant thorn in the Simpson family's side. He is understood to be remorseless when he wants something, and work himself half to death to get it. Being a genius, he got wealthy, powerful, and earned respect, but this didn't satisfy his lust for Marge. Unlike Homer, Artie only liked Marge for her aesthetic appeal, and didn't respect her opinions, as he constantly groped Marge against her will. This selfishness cost him his only love, unless you count Artie Ziff's narcissistic love of himself.
 Artie was a student at Springfield High School. He was an excellent student, doing well in academics and participating in debate. Marge Bouvier was also a member of the debate team and was impressed with Artie winning a debate match. He asked Marge to the prom, and she said yes. However, there was conflict as Homer Simpson had asked her earlier to the prom, to which she also said yes, but later got angry with him when he elected to be honest with her (admitting he signed up for her tutoring in a class he did not take). Marge was torn when both boys showed up to the Bouvier residence. She was again angry with Homer for not understanding she was mad with him, but Homer insisted she accepted his invitation and is going back on her word. She elected to go with Artie, whom her sisters were impressed with. The promgoers were also impressed with Artie, electing him and Marge king and queen of the prom. However, the wonderful evening turned nasty in private. Artie sought to celebrate their crowning of king and queen of the prom by getting fresh with Marge in the backseat of his car. Marge demands Artie cut it out, but in the passion he grabs at her, resulting in the shoulder strap of Marge's dress being torn, followed by a slap to the face and a swift end to their date. Sobered, Artie stops, and Marge coldly suggests it is best if he go home. Artie agrees, but before arriving at the Ziff residence he claims his academic credentials and recent win in debate have earned him such a superior reputation that the entire town of Springfield would be shamed if news of his ""busy hands"" was to become public. Marge gives her annoyed grunt, realizing she knows of his true reputation before God, and does not buy Artie's plea (but makes no further mention of the matter). As Marge returns home, she overhears her parents discussing with her, saying that her father liked Homer. Marge then drives to find Homer, and quickly finds him walking home alone. She picks him up and accepts his gift of a corsage he bought for her, using it to tie up the shoulder strap on her dress Artie ripped.
 Sometime after graduating from high school, he would found Ziffcorp, a software company, and collect a tremendous fortune.
 Many years later, he was revealed to have become a software billionaire, becoming the fifth richest man in the country. His wealth came from a device that transformed modem noise into easy listening music. Despite his riches, Artie's life was not complete: He lived alone, never having married. Most other people chalked up Artie's solitary lifestyle to either dedicating himself to his work or being astute to weeding out women who only wanted him for his money. However, it was revealed that he had a secret room full of statues, pictures, and other artworks resembling Marge, showing that he never got over Marge rejecting him, and also strongly suggested he had an unhealthy obsession with Marge. Even so, at this point Artie still restrained himself from engaging in stalking or other aspects of erotomania.
 Artie claimed that he would offer a small fortune for a weekend with his childhood love, Marge, in a parody of the movie Indecent Proposal; she accepted, as the money would come in handy, and he seemed harmless. He manages to trick Marge into kissing him at a full recreation of their high school prom (including most of the original guests), which Homer witnessed the wrong end of. She slaps Artie and leaves. After a fruitless search for Homer, who left believing that they were having an affair, she enlisted Artie's help, using his helicopter to find Homer and bring him home. When they find him, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions.
 Some time later, the Simpsons discovered that Artie was squatting in their attic. He reveals that he ran his company, Ziffcorp, into the ground and was left penniless when the ""dot-com bubble"" burst. He is also wanted for defalcation, fraud and grand larceny. In private, Artie admits his company had fallen on hard times and he had bolstered his lifestyle by spending money entrusted to him by investors on his own personal gain and enjoyment, which made him guilty of running a Ponzi scam. Homer won 98% of the company from Ziff in a game of poker; seconds later, SEC agents came to take Ziff, but they took Homer into custody instead. It was later revealed that Artie had anticipated the authorities closing in. He bet his worthless shares and intentionally played a bad hand, figuring when the authorities arrives that Homer would be left holding the bag as he unknowingly found himself the majority owner of Ziffcorp.
 Realizing that Marge will never forgive him for letting Homer go to prison, Artie clears her husband’s name by admitting to the authorities he set Homer up and that he is guilty of the outstanding crimes. Homer is released, and Marge thanks Artie for doing the right thing with a kiss on the cheek. However, one of his first acts upon arriving in prison was to begin extinguishing other prisoners' cigarettes with a squirt bottle (allegedly to save their lungs). Marge told the children to take their last look at Artie, as his actions dramatically lowered his chances of survival. Artie was last seen continuing to squirt other prisoners' cigarettes while an ever-growing angry mob advanced on him. What happened to Artie after that (or even whether he survived the encounter) wasn’t initially known. It appears he is alive, however, for in the Season 22 episode, ""The Fool Monty,"" Artie's name is last on the list of people who want five minutes of revenge on Mr. Charles Montgomery Burns, suggesting that Artie Ziff and Charles Burns are business rivals.
 Eventually, Artie was released from prison and attended the Simpsons' Mardi Gras Party.
 Artie reappeared in a segment of Treehouse of Horror XXIII, which is a spoof of the film Back to the Future. In it, he won Marge's heart during their date to the prom after Bart altered Homer's first meeting with Marge while time-traveling. When Bart returns to the present time, he finds that Artie is now his and his sisters biological father and the family is extremely wealthy. Also, the children have inherited Artie's curly hairstyle. When the present Homer, who had spent the last decades stalking Marge, tries to intervene with the help of numerous Homers from several points in the past, Artie and Bart, both fight them off with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. However, Marge, upon spotting them, becomes interested in all of the Homers. The teenage Homer from 1974, who stowed away in the time machine, returns to 1974 and undoes all the damage Bart did to the space-time continuum, causing Bartie Ziff to become Bart Simpson again as Marge is once again married to Homer, and Artie Ziff fades away.
 Artie Ziff is voiced by Jon Lovitz in a recurring role. Dan Castellaneta voiced him in ""The Front"", arguably due to the very small appearance of Artie in that episode.
 His I.Q. is 132.

The Yes Guy,True,False,False,False,False,10,Castellaneta,148,"The Yes Guy, named Mr. Pettigrew, but normally referred to as ""That Annoying Guy Who Always Says ""Eeeh-Ye-e-e-es?"" or That Jerk That Goes '""Eeeh-Ye-e-e-es?"", and sometimes referred to as ""The Obnoxious Yes Guy"" by Homer, is a resident of Springfield. He is known for bellowing “Eeeh-Ye-e-e-es?!” in a rising inflection, and appears to be highly eccentric in both his speech and appearance.
 When Homer asked the Yes Guy why he talked like that, Yes Guy responded with, “I had a stro-o-oke!”. He is often seen working at Costington's department store, and is apparently on good terms with Mr. Costington. When Lisa was put on trial for teaching fellow students about Darwin, Yes Guy was juror number twelve. He also once worked as an ice cream truck driver and gave Bart some free ice cream. Apu considers the Yes Guy to be very, very funny.
 The Yes Guy also once worked for the reality show Frame Up, where he pretended to take a phone call from the governor regarding whether a condemned Homer should be reprieved. During the call, he used his catchphrase (and a ""No"" version of it) several times.
 He also appears in The Simpsons: Tapped Out has a character for your Springfield. Jobs you can give him include calling a doctor to investigate his verbal tic, and feeling in shame due to it.
 His jobs include being a cop, an employee for Costington's, Springfield Dinner Theater, Barney's Bowlarama, as well as running an Ice Cream Truck.
 The Yes Guy is a tribute to character actor Frank Nelson, and his familiar persona on The Jack Benny Program (modified for appearances on I Love Lucy, The Flintstones, Sanford and Son, Garfield &amp; Friends, and others). Nelson's trademark greeting was a loud, drawn-out “Yeeeeesss?!” This was often augmented with a sarcastic ""OoOOOoooh!"" Originally, this character could be found in a variety of occupations, usually as a salesman or waiter, at establishments which Jack Benny or others might be patronizing, and his Simpsonian counterpart is equally omnipresent. He always says ""Yeeeeeeeees"" that might be his catchphrase.
 His color scheme slightly changed a few times during his early appearances. In ""Mayored to the Mob"" he had gray hair, in ""Homer vs. Dignity"" he had brown hair, and in ""The Lastest Gun in the West"" he had darker skin with black hair. His current color scheme of traditional yellow skin with black hair debuted in ""The Frying Game"".
 A Brazilian doppelganger of the Yes Guy can be seen in the episode ""Blame It on Lisa,"" uttering a Portuguese variation of the catchphrase: ""Eeh-Si-ii-ii-iiii""?!

Ms. Mellon,False,False,False,True,False,1,Wallace,149,"Ms. Mellon (/mɛlˈarn/) is the fourth grade teacher at the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children that Bart briefly attended after cheating on an intelligence test.
 Ms. Mellon was Bart's new fourth grade teacher when he went to the gifted school after Bart cheated off Martin Prince's I.Q. Test and was recognized as a genius with an I.Q. of 216. Ms. Mellon was calm and nurturing to her students and encouraged independence and creativity in a pedagogically progressive environment, which heavily contrasted Mrs. Krabappel's class. Ms. Mellon was very patient and hopeful of Bart's abilities despite his slips of dim-wittedness, at least until Bart's chemistry accident where he mixed 'acids and bases'.
 In Bart Gets an ""F"", Ms. Mellon was singing with the townsfolk during the snow day. She also plays a part in the musical Oh, Streetcar! in A Streetcar Named Marge. In Mr. Plow, Ms. Mellon gets frightened by Barney Gumble in the street while he is working as a mascot for Lullabuy$. In Marge vs. the Monorail, she attended the town meeting that discussed the usage of Mr. Burns' seized money; initially, she is for its usage to repair Main Street, but ultimately shows support for Lyle Lanley's Springfield Monorail. She is also one the passengers of the monorail's botched maiden voyage. In Bart's Inner Child, she attended Brad Goodman's Inner Child Workshop. In Homer the Smithers, Ms. Mellon also attends the Nuclear Plant Employee Appreciation Night at the drag racing track with her family. It is possible that her husband works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.
 In the music video for Do the Bartman, she is briefly seen dancing with Jacques.
 In the 'Lies to Tell Your Parents' section of Bart Simpson's Guide to Life, Ms. Mellon's portrait says, 'You'll be sorry.'
 Ms. Mellon's discarding the comic book into the trash can was a source of minor controversy. Mail was received that considered the act a form of censorship.

Cowboy Bob,True,False,False,False,False,1,stars,150,"Cowboy Bob is an RV salesman.
 When the Simpsons see Ned just got a new expensive RV, the family decides to get one and goes to Bob's RV Round-Up. They then see a huge RV named The Ultimate Behemoth and Homer tries to get it but brings sales down so much the Simpsons have to get a cheaper one. In Bart Gets an ""F"", he is seen singing in the snow between Marge and Jasper. He later attempts to trick Homer in regards to an RV when Homer needed a Nest Egg, and also had Homer and his kids shipped to Turkey.
 Bob works at Bob's RV Round-Up, but he does not own the place (possibly a lie to get sales). He is the ultimate shark salesman and knows a sucker when he sees one. Bob takes the Simpsons on a tour of the ""Ultimate Behemoth"". However, he ignores Marge's inquisitions for the price of the RV, most likely because he is aware of the fact that he knows her family cannot afford it.
 While at his lot, Bob is informed by one of his salesmen that Lisa and Bart are heading back to return the RV Homer bought with the money Marge saved, which frightens him as he never gave back money and told the same salesman to tie him up on to the giant blimp gorilla and let it go as he does not want to return their money. However, when it is destroyed, he is overjoyed as he gets to keep the money.

Jacques,True,False,False,False,False,1,stars,151,"After Homer Simpson bought a bowling ball for himself and diguised it as Marge's birthday gift, Marge went to bowling, where she met Jacques. Jacques, captivated by Marge, agreed to give her lessons in the hopes of wooing her. Marge, though charmed by Jacques, eventually confessed that she was already married, though Jacques was undeterred and offered to take Marge to brunch, during which he asked her to meet with him at his apartment in Fiesta Terraces. Marge accepted, but remembering her commitment to Homer, she chose to stick with Homer and abandoned Jacques. Notably, Marge believed that his last name was ""Brunswick"", because it was engraved on his bowling ball yet that was really only the brand of his ball.
 He is later as a part of a bowling team called the Home Wreckers, consisting of Princess Kashmir, Mindy Simmons, and Lurleen Lumpkin.
 He appeared in The Simpsons: Tapped Out as a character exclusively for the Pin Pals mini-event, and it's his very first appearance in a Simpsons video game.
 He returned when Homer hires him to prepare Marge for the bowling tournament that will save Barney's Bowlarama, unaware of his interest in Marge. Jacques once again tries to woo Marge despite swearing on cheese that their relationship is professional. Homer eventually finds out and storms into Jacques' apartment where he finds a shrine to Marge. Homer and Jacques battle with bowling balls and Homer eventually wins, but Marge stops Homer and assures him that nothing happened with Jacques and that she loves him. Jacques competes against Marge in the bowling tournament as revenge, but Marge wins once again leaving Jacques with nothing. He then gets deported back to France, as he had been living in the US on an expired visa.
 Seen in the crowd Jacques is somewhat of a Casanova and mainly seems to try to seduce his clients instead of actually teaching them anything. In later episodes he can be briefly seen. In ""Burns' Heir"" he is seen kissing Edna Krabappel on a secret camera. The footage is briefly seen in Burns' Surveillance Room.

 Dark is seen singing at the Sapphire Lounge near the Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn. He sings ""If I Could Love A Million Girls"" right before Homer makes his speech about not seeing women as objects. After hearing Homer's plea, he is moved by it and calls his own mother in tears. Dark is also the singer in Tito Puente's band.
 Dark also appeared, played by McMurray, on The Tracey Ullman Show in several skits during the time the original shorts were included on the show.

Adil Hoxha,True,False,False,False,False,1,MacNeille,154,"Adil Hoxha was a foreign exchange student from Albania. He stayed with the Simpson family while Bart was in France, and was discovered to be a Communist spy. He is a main character in the Season One episode The Crepes of Wrath, where he makes his first (and to date only) significant appearance in the series.
 Under the foreign exchange student program, Adil was sent to live with the Simpsons for three months while Bart was sent to France. Adil got along well with everyone in the family, especially Homer, and was kind and polite to everyone. Homer, touched that Adil was so interested in his work (completely unlike his own kids), took a shine to him and showed him all over Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Adil, for his part, took plenty of pictures and asked Homer lots of technical questions about the plant. Homer told Adil everything he wanted to know, even giving him a set of blueprints of the nuclear plant.
 It was later discovered, however, that Adil was a spy. He had set up a fax machine and lots of radio and electronic equipment in Bart's treehouse, and was making regular reports to Albania, sending the very information that Homer had given him and the pictures he had taken (a number of which showed Homer posing in front of the machines in the plant). Adil was caught by the FBI when they raided the neighborhood. Instead of being punished, Adil was deported back to Albania and exchanged for an American child spy who had been caught in Albania. In spite of Adil's being a spy, the Simpsons were all sad to see him go.
 Adil was later seen on a boat full of immigrants sailing into New York City. Bart, from inside the Statue of Liberty, hollered at them that the country was full, and the boat turned away and headed for Canada. It is likely, therefore, that Adil Hoxha ended up in Canada.
 The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants
 Adil appears as an enemy in the Krustyland stage, he throws bombs from the top of a carnival game. Due to the NES's limited color pallet he has blue hair and blue clothes in this appearance.  
 Adil in Bart vs. The Space Mutants Most of Adil's roles are only brief; the bold text indicates his major role.

Lucille Botzcowski,False,False,False,False,False,1,stars,155,"Lucille Botzcowski, also known as Miss Botz and the ""Babysitter Bandit"", is a burglar who poses as a babysitter and robs the homes of the children she babysits. Her only major appearance so far was in ""Some Enchanted Evening"", when she was hired as the babysitter for Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. She is voiced by the late Penny Marshall.
 Lucille Botzcowski is an escaped criminal, known as the ""Babysitter Bandit"". She is hired by Homer from the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers Babysitting Service to babysit Bart, Lisa and Maggie while he and Marge go out on a date. After her arrival, Bart and Lisa discover her true identity as a burglar when they see her on the TV show America's Most Armed &amp; Dangerous, but they are captured and tied up before they can call the police. She then starts looting the Simpson house. Maggie unties Bart and Lisa, and they are able to thwart and tie up Lucille. Bart and Lisa call the police, but before they arrive Homer and Marge return home to find Lucille hog-tied with her mouth taped shut, staring helplessly at a Happy Little Elves videotape that she forced Bart and Lisa to watch earlier. Deceiving Homer into freeing her, she advises him to not ""turn your back on that boy for a second"" and drives away after being paid triple the original fee for her trouble, just moments before the police arrived. 
 Lucille makes a brief appearance in ""Bart Gets an ""F"""" while the Springfield residents stand in a circle and sing during the snow day festivities. She apparently remained free for some time as she was briefly mentioned in a newscast in ""Bart's Dog Gets an F"" that the police are looking for her.
 A wanted sign featuring her photograph was briefly seen on the notice board in the Springfield Police Station behind Chief Wiggum's desk, but showed her sporting brown hair. She later appeared in Calmwood Mental Hospital, pacing back and forth in a threatening manner. The cell door was unlocked and unguarded;it is unknown if she escaped or not, although she did briefly appear in her car in the non-canon Family Guy crossover ""The Simpsons Guy"".
 She also appeared as the boss of Springfield Mall in The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants, where she frequently tried to drop luggage onto Bart, the main protagonist of the game and the player. Depending on whether Marge's name was spelled earlier, she will either deflect any luggage away from Bart, or Bart will have to dodge the luggage. Bart defeated her by throwing the luggage back at her.

Karl,True,True,False,False,False,2,stars,156,"Are you looking for Homer's friend, Carl Carlson?
 Karl is the former assistant of Homer Simpson. He is perhaps one of Springfield's strangest residents, due to his strange obsession with Homer.
 Karl is the mysterious guardian angel of Homer. Very little is known of his prior life, yet establishes himself very early as a confident mentor who seemingly dedicates himself to the growth of Homer’s abilities and confidence. Karl is one of the very few citizens of Springfield who emits such a powerful ‘purity’. However, beyond his life with Homer almost nothing is known, except that he lives alone. Karl truly is one of the most special people of Springfield; Karl’s strange fixation and die hard dedication creates an oddity of a person.
 He has white hair (behind Horatio McCallister) Karl  is always seen dressed very well in suits of assorted colors and the occasional turtle neck and scarf. He speaks with a voice that is gravelly, yet soft. He has short, blonde hair. However, in later episodes he is seen with white hair.
 Homer has recently been promoted to an executive. Frightened and well aware of his under-qualification, he anxiously interviews applicants for the secretary position. One woman's ‘resoomes’ seem in order, but her offer of a back rub makes Homer nervous and he quickly shoos her out. Marge calls Homer to see how things are going. He complains that every woman he interviews makes ‘kissy faces’, sparking Marge’s jealousy. Suddenly a shadow appears and Homer is saved, “Hello Mr. Simpsons. I'm Karl.” Marge is relieved by the male voice and urges Homer to hire him. Waylon Smithers, Jr. interrupts, informing Homer about an upcoming meeting and that all he is to do is keep his mouth shut. Karl quickly points out to Homer that he is clearly ""a fraud"" and doesn't ""belong here"". Frightened, Homer asks how he knew at which point Karl lists his obvious flaws but embarks on a campaign to improve him. Karl immediately improves Homer's self image with a rousing pep talk having Homer exclaim, ""I am nature's greatest miracle!"" He excitedly hires Karl, along with his requested three weeks vacation and moving expenses, who immediately takes him shopping.
 Karl soon proves his abilities by redefining Homer’s image. Taken to a clothing store, Homer searches blindly. Karl acts as a backbone and does his best to make Homer feel like the ‘prince’ he should. Homer, now prepared for anything, goes to leave for work forgetting it is he and Marge’s anniversary. Homer quickly goes into apology act, as he would any other time. Yet Marge says she understands this year because Homer is now a busy executive. As Homer goes to leave,  a singer jumps into the room and sings for Marge. Homer is surprised but Marge believes it is a romantic gesture from him. Karl calls at that moment to check to see if the singer he hired has arrived. We see a lonely Karl in his large apartment. Despite the seemingly loneliness of his life, Karl is overjoyed with Homer’s success with Marge. Marge buys the swindle, Homer is happy to go along and Karl is only as happy as Homer is.
 Homer pulls off a ‘Homer Simpson’  in the boardroom, resulting in a ‘promotion’ – access to the executive bathroom. And of course, the first man to bring awareness to such great news is an excited Karl (and a glum Smithers). Proudly, Karl escorts Homer through a highly regarded honor in the workplace. Homer is yet again brought to his knees by Mr. Burns’ request for a speech to the executives. However, before Karl can offer his help they are interrupted by a sleuthing Smithers – the night before he had discovered Homer’s health insurance fraud. Smithers attempts to fire Homer, but of course the angelic selflessness of Karl causes him to take the bullet. With no hesitation, Karl takes the blame for the fraud, resulting in the termination of his job. Homer is baffled by his act and yet again Karl finds a way to explain himself, leaving Homer even more baffled. 
As Karl says his final goodbyes to Homer at the plant exit, it is raining. As he strolls through the rain with his umbrella, Karl asks in a very polite manner, “Mr. Simpson, did you bring an umbrella”. A ""D’oh"" assures Karl that Homer does not have one. Perhaps, in one of the most thoughtful and beautiful things to ever happen in Springfield, Karl tosses Homer his umbrella and continues in the rain soaked.
 Due to Bart’s mischief, Homer loses his hair. He returns with all confidence lost preparing for the speech. He finds a note, Karl strikes again. Karl has written the entire speech for Homer. Homer reads the letter, however it is revealed it was actually Karl in the room narrating the letter. He explains he came back to say bye to ‘the girls at the typing pool’. Homer tells Karl he cannot do the speech because of his baldness, sparking an angry and inspiring speech from Karl. Karl then kisses Homer to prove he is not a fool, and off Homer goes to face the music. Unfortunately, Homer’s speech fails, not because of the speech itself (which was brilliantly written), but Homer’s lack of hair instantly alienated the crowd.
 Karl dancing with Jacques in the ""Do the Bartman"" music video. Karl’s fate is not fully known. After being fired, he is briefly seen throughout Springfield in crowds, drawing the conclusion that he still lives and resides in his apartment. He is also seen in the “Do the Bartman” music video dancing with Jacques. Karl mentioned his mother at one stage, but she is never mentioned or seen again.
 Karl was originally designed in Fierstein’s likeness. However, this design was scrapped because Fierstein thought he wasn’t a good depiction of the homosexual community. This adds to a theory that Karl is homosexual, or in the very least illustrates Fierstein believes Karl is meant to be homosexual.
 Although it is never directly said, It has been suggested that Karl is homosexual. There are many indications for this theory as he kisses Homer during his pep talk and explains, ""My mother taught me never to kiss a fool"" before slapping Homer's buttocks. In addition, Karl was voiced by the openly gay actor Harvey Fierstein. Also, the scrapping of the original design backs this theory. 
 Karl kisses Homer. Karl was intended to return in the episode, ""Three Gays of the Condo"". This episode would have had Karl living and in a relationship with another man, though Fierstein declined to reappear. As a result, Karl was replaced by Grady.

 Bart tells his second scary story to Lisa called ""Hungry are the Damned"". In the story, Serak prepared the Simpson family as dinner while the spaceship was heading to Rigel 7. Serak was also mentioned in the Bart Simpson Comics story ""Cooking with Kang &amp; Kodos."" He is said to weigh a ton, and tells the Simpsons family that his name can only be pronounced correctly if their tongues are pulled out.
 The name Serak was obviously adopted from Star Trek's character Sarek (the father of Spock), just as the name Kang and Kodos are also names taken from the original Star Trek.

Toshiro,True,False,False,False,False,2,stars,158,"Toshiro is the apprentice sushi chef at The Happy Sumo, assisting the Master Sushi Chef.
 Toshiro is young and (compared to the Master Sushi Chef) not yet very skilled in his job.  For that reason, when the Master Sushi Chef was out of the kitchen (making out with Mrs. Krabappel in the parking lot), Toshiro sought his assistance when Homer Simpson ordered fugu.  Knowing that he wasn't qualified to prepare fugu, Toshiro appealed to the Master Sushi Chef's ego, telling him that his skilled hands were needed in the kitchen.  The Master Sushi Chef angrily said that his skilled hands were busy elsewhere (with Mrs. Krabappel), and -- not realizing that someone had ordered fugu -- told Toshiro to take care of it himself.
 Left on his own with the task, Toshiro very carefully studied a chart illustrating the procedure for cutting blowfish to make fugu.  However, he was distracted by Homer's yelling for his fugu, made a hasty cut, and put the fugu out for Akira the waiter to serve.  When the Master Sushi Chef finally returned from the parking lot and saw the cut blowfish, he was shocked to see what Toshiro had done.
 Toshiro ended up having to tell Homer about his possibly having been poisoned, but also told him not to panic, as there was a map to the hospital on the back of the menu. Fortunately, his hasty cut had been the right one and managed to prepare it safely, as the end of the episode revealed.

When Homer ordered fugu, Toshiro called the Master Sushi Chef, telling him that his skilled hands were needed in the kitchen, but he said his skilled hands were busy elsewhere (making out with Edna Krabappel). He returns in the kitchen and realises in shock that the fugu has been serve and hasn't been cut properly, He is then enraged with Toshiro for being careless.
 In addition to being self-centered (as seen when he wouldn't leave Mrs. Krabappel to return to the kitchen), the Master Sushi Chef is egotistical and arrogant, but in some ways rightly so, as he has mastered the art of fugu preparation. However, he also delights in humiliating Toshiro, telling Toshiro to hang his head in shame after he (the Master Sushi Chef) demonstrates his superior skills. He has a girlfriend, Edna Krabappel

She believes that ""choke"" and ""chain"" are the most important words in life. Her favorite magazine is JOCO (Journal of Canine Obedience). She humiliates the owners of bad dogs, while rewarding dogs and people equally.
 She is the ""Systematic Self-Esteem Squasher"" type of mom you meet at the PTA.
 In ""Bart's Dog Gets an F"", The Simpson family, tired of Santa's Little Helper's ill-training, brings him to Emily Winthrop's Canine College. 
 She seems to have little patience with Bart and his disobedient dog, stating ""Perhaps I cling to the old ways like a well-chewed shoe... as the traditions I was weaned on are put to sleep, or neutered, one by one. But my time has not passed yet! We do not need another college graduate who doesn't know how to sit!""
 Eventually, through bonding with Bart (and not through Winthrop's ""Choke Chain"" technique, Santa's Little Helper passes the course, causing Winthrop to exclaim, ""You son of a bitch! Good show!""
 In ""Old Money"", she is seen waiting in line to see Abe Simpson and plead her case as to why she deserves part of the money he inherited from Beatrice Simmons. Also joining her in line are Batman's Joker, Star Wars' Darth Vader, as well as many Springfield residents.
 In ""When Flanders Failed"", she is seen at The Leftorium after Homer invites customers to save Ned Flanders' store. From this, we can infer that Winthrop is left-handed.

Beatrice Simmons,False,False,False,False,False,2,Meadows,161,"Beatrice “Bea” Simmons was Grandpa Simpson's short-lived girlfriend. She bears a striking resemblance to Mary Bailey.
 Grampa Simpson met her at the Springfield Retirement Castle help desk when the staff accidentally swaps their medications. It was love at first sight for Grampa, and they start dating.
 They arrange another date for Bea's birthday, but Grampa is forced to stand her up when Homer abducts him onto one of the family's once-a-month day trips to ""Discount Lion Safari"". When he returns to the Retirement Castle, he discovers that Bea has died. Jasper explains that Bea's left ventricle burst; she literally died from a broken heart. Bea also mentioned that she had liver failure while dating Abe. 
 Beatrice's Tombstone shown in ""Alone Again, Natura-Diddily"" Grampa then learns that Bea left him thousands of dollars. He tells Homer to make him envious. While interviewing potential candidates, Lisa tells Grampa none of them deserve the money and tells him to use it to help the poor.
 While trying unsuccessfully to enjoy his inheritance, Grampa sees Bea's ghost, who suggests he give it those that can use it. After explaining to him that death is not so scary, she says that she is haunting a family in Texas. Bea also tells Abraham that Homer is very sorry for interfering with their last date, and urges Abe to make peace with his son.
 Grampa visits areas of Springfield and realizes he doesn't have enough money to help them all. He decides to gamble to increase his money and does so by a substantial amount, but Homer stops him just before he loses it all. He forgives Homer, and after looking at the other seniors outside the casino, Grampa decides to use Bea's money to renovate the Retirement Castle. We then see that the Retirement Castle has become a beautiful place to live, featuring a brand new 'Beatrice Simmons Memorial Dining Hall.'
 In the episode she mentioned having a husband named Charlie Simmons. She also has the same last name as Mindy Simmons, whom Homer fell for. Both him and Abe started relationships with them.

 In every negative statement that Professor Lombardo says he balances it out with something positive, such as when Marge was happy that Professor Lombardo liked her paintings of Ringo Starr when her high school art teacher did not, Lombardo says ""The man was a fool!"", but then adds ""But you must admire his strong convictions"". When Professor Lombardo is praising Marge winning first prize for her painting of Homer he comments on her ""bald Adonis"" and momentarily removes his sunglasses for Marge, implying he may have a mild infatuation with Marge; himself being ¾ bald. He chooses Marge's painting abilities to host the opening of Mr. Burns art wing in the Museum.

Mr. Bergstrom,True,False,False,False,False,2,stars,163,"Mr. Bergstrom was Lisa Simpson's substitute teacher for a period of time.
 Mr. Bergstrom took over for Ms. Hoover after she believed she had Lyme Disease and Lisa immediately took to him because he was the kind of male role model she needed in her life, but he had to leave Springfield after Ms. Hoover returned. A distraught Lisa ran to stop him, and Mr. Bergstrom gave her a note saying ""You are Lisa Simpson"" before moving to Capitol City, where he said he got a job near the government housing projects. His final words to Lisa were ""It will be okay Lisa, just read the note!"".
 When Lisa was sad because Maggie was smarter than her, Marge gave Lisa a paper that said ""You are Lisa Simpson"" and then Lisa says, ""I already have one of those,"" referring to Mr. Bergstrom's note.
 Mr Bergstrom made a non-speaking cameo on ""The Kid Is All Right"". Marge informed Lisa her food was getting cold. When Lisa stated her raw vegetables are supposed to be cold, Marge stated ""someone who loves you"" was adding hot butter to her food. Marge is shown thanking Mr. Bergstrom and stated she would inform Lisa that he came by.
 Mr. Bergstrom is an intelligent, sophisticated, dedicated, loving, and charismatic teacher who really does care about the students more than romantic relationships, his closest relationship being with Lisa. He becomes a giant inspiration on her.
 He, like his voice actor, Dustin Hoffman, is Jewish. He is an artistic, liberal teacher who tries to inspire his students, even though that means some will make fun of him, by drawing a picture of him with his guitar and naming him ""The Singing Dork"". Instead of being offended by this, however, he laughs and asks Lisa if he may keep it. Lisa says she did not draw it, although his praise of the art makes her wish she did. Mr. Bergstrom also encourages the students to patronize the Springfield Museum of Natural History, as it will soon be going bankrupt. This inspires Lisa to visit, and Homer is grudgingly made to chaperone her. Mr. Bergstrom encourages Homer to think more highly of himself, for he is the only man in the world who is Lisa's father.

Leon Kompowsky,True,False,False,False,False,3,Azaria,164,"Kompowsky worked as a bricklayer in Paterson, New Jersey during his early life and was angry about himself until he started impersonating the voice of Michael Jackson, which gained him respect. He was placed in New Bedlam Insane Asylum where he later met Homer Simpson, who got hospitalized for wearing a pink shirt to work. Leon impersonated Jackson and performed part of ""Billie Jean,"" though Homer had no clue who Jackson is (which shocked Leon). After getting released, Homer invites him to come visit his home since he was only in the hospital voluntarily, (But Homer doubted this when Leon told him that he was a vegetarian and he doesn't drink) and Bart, thinking that Kompowsky is the real Michael Jackson, tells everyone. The entire town shows up to see Michael Jackson, only to learn that it is fake. Bart becomes hated in the town, and Lisa hates him too for forgetting her birthday. Kompowsky decides to set things right and helps Bart write a special birthday song for Lisa. In the end, his work is done, so Kompowsky drops the Jackson charade and starts talking in his normal voice, citing his reasons for doing the voice was a result of anger and he felt respected when he did the Jackson impersonation, he then cites his work at the Simpson home was done prior to leaving. As he walks away, he starts re-singing Lisa's birthday song in his normal voice.
 Kompowsky does make an appearance in the Simpson Comics as a janitor for the mental facility. Since then, he hasn't made an appearance.
 In ""The Simpsons 2009 Calendar"", Kompowsky can be seen as part of the angry mob for the month of February.
 Kompowsky appeared as a character in The Simpsons: Tapped Out during the Homerpalooza 2017 event in Act 2 (Pop).
 He made an appearance in Mr. Lisa's Opus where he sings the same song with Bart for Lisa again on her fourteenth birthday, though this time she's less than impressed.
 Despite being in a mental institution, he is not insane. Rather, his apparent delusion is a personal choice to deal with aggression. He is a kind-hearted, gentle, friendly, nice, musical and caring man. He explained in his backstory that he used to be always angry, but after he learned to talk in a nice way, he learned that he could make people happy, so he decided to be a nice person.

Bob Arnold,True,False,False,False,False,3,Azaria,165,"At first, he seemed like a decent guy, as evidenced by Moe and Barney's opinion of him, and even Lisa's. However, prior to Lisa's first encounter with him, he was talking to a lobbyist representing the Timber Company about tearing down Springfield Forest, and was about to accept it, but decided to try and postpone it and meet somewhere secret when Lisa and her family arrived. He later meets with the Timber lobbyist at the Winifred Beecher Howe museum exhibit (as it was allegedly the least likely place someone would stumble on the meeting). When asked on his standing, he accepted the bribe (or, as he answered it, ""let me put it this way: Timbeeeeerrrrrrr!!""). However, Lisa also happened to be at the exhibit admiring it when she witnessed the whole bribe. After witnessing it, she decided to make a new essay that condemns democracy and exposes Bob Arnold's accepting the bribe. Thanks to the inflammatory essay, the FBI quickly caught wind of his activities. He was arrested for accepting a bribe to allow oil drilling on President Roosevelt's head on Mount Rushmore in a sting operation, and was expelled from Congress. His arrest brought back Lisa's faith in the system. According to the Washington Beacon, he had become a born-again Christian shortly after being removed from office. He would have worked with the late Horace Wilcox as a fellow congressman for Springfield's State.
 Congressman Arnold's first meeting with Lisa showed he had much political savvy and social graces, as he charms Lisa by saying one day she may grow up to be a Congresswoman and commends Lisa for correctly stating how many women were Members of Congress. He gets photographs taken of himself with Lisa, which get put into Springfield newspapers and are all that is needed to convince Barney and Moe that he is a decent man worthy of reelection, which serves to show the ease Congressman have in convincing voters to keep reelecting them (or at least Moe &amp; Barney). Other than the logging bribe and the failed Roosevelt Oil bribe, it is implied he may have also been involved in the Superfund scandals, or at least had knowledge of it, when he expressed his reluctance to approve the logging contract by remarking to the lobbyist ""This is not like burying toxic waste; people are going to notice those trees are gone"". Also, he may be somewhat of a womanizer, as he said ""Look, what a pooch"" in regards to Winifred Beecher Howe's statue.
 Ironically, like Arnold, Ohio U.S. Congressman James Traficant would be expelled and sent to prison after being convicted on corruption charges which included accepting bribes in 2002. U.S. President George W. Bush, the son of the episode's then-President George H.W. Bush, would sign House Resolution 495, which, like Arnold, made Traficant's expulsion from Congress official.https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-resolution/495/text However, it was never made public during Traficant's lifetime if, like Arnold, he became a born-again Christian.

Samantha Stankey,False,False,False,False,False,3,stars,170,"Samantha Stankey is a young girl who goes to Springfield Elementary School, where she is a new student at school.
 Samantha introduces herself to Bart's class Milhouse and Samantha together She first fell in love with Milhouse on the schoolyard after she accidentally hit him with a ball. After Milhouse invites Samantha to Bart's treehouse, they spend a great deal of time together kissing, making Bart feel left out in the process.
 The following day, when Samantha and Milhouse are in the treehouse and are about to kiss, her father shows up and catches the both of them together (due to Bart telling him about their romance). Samantha's father grabs her out of the treehouse and asks her what is going on. Before she can explain the whole story, her father berates her and orders her never to see Milhouse again. Because of this, her father takes her out of Springfield Elementary and transfers her to Saint Sebastian's School for Wicked Girls, a convent school run by French-Canadian nuns.
 A few days later, Bart and Milhouse visit Samantha at her new school during recess. Milhouse gives her a gallon of gummy worms, while Bart apologizes for telling her father about their romance but she forgave Bart because she loves the school and the nuns are really nice. As recess ends, Samantha shares one last kiss with Milhouse before going back inside, while knowing that she may receive a punishment of 50 rosaries for doing so.
 Samantha has long wavy light brown hair and wears braces in her teeth. In her debut appearance, she wore a lavender blouse, a pink dress, white socks, and pink Mary Janes. In later appearances, her pink clothes changed to sea green.
 Samantha is a good student with a record of fairly good attendance and no detention. Her interest include reading girl comics such as ""Bonnie Crane: Girl Attorney"", ""Punkin &amp; Dunkin, the Twinkle Twins"", and ""Lil' Kneesocks"". Samantha also hates the dress that her father makes her wear. Samantha once had a bed-wetting problem up until second grade.
 Even though Samantha has been put in an all-girls school and never mentioned again after her final kiss with Milhouse, there have been a number of girls that closely resemble her who have made brief cameos throughout the series (one of which attends Springfield Elementary).
 Samantha's look-a-like in current episodes as of Season 17 Unlike the real Samantha, this girl wears a teal-green dress and has rounder eyes. This girl is first seen playing the saxophone at Jazzy Goodtime's. During Martin Prince's memorial when he was thought to have died, another girl can be seen sitting in the bleachers. In Stealing First Base, she is one of the students in Audrey McConnell's 4th grade class. She is seen a second time in the same episode when Bart and Nikki McKenna skateboard around the schoolyard, the same girl is seen sitting at a table outside with other children. She is also seen a third time at the school assemble where the children laugh when Principal Skinner is kissed by Groundskeeper Willie. During Lisa's lecture about the Simpson ancestors, a girl looking like Samatha was seen sitting in the school hall.
 When Moe converts his bar into a family-style restaurant, a girl who resembles a younger version of Samantha complains to him that her ice-cold soft drink ""makes her teeth hurt"" . Another girl is seen singing at Krusty's doorstep on the Christmas special, ""It's a Krusty Kinda Kristmas"".
 The physical appearance of Samantha is based on Wallace Wolodarsky's niece, who is also named Samantha. Samantha's physical appearance also resemble the design art of characters who would appear in shows such as Rugrats and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, due to Klasky-Csupo, Inc.'s involvement in the animation art of the Ullman shorts and first 61 episodes.

Mr. Black,True,False,False,False,False,4,Shearer,171,"Mr. Black was the camp director of Kamp Krusty.
 Mr. Black does very little work, instead relying on the services of the school bullies Jimbo Jones, Dolph and Kearney to ""crush their spirits"", who run the ""Kamp Krusty"" with an iron fist. Mr. Black also hired a retired drill instructor, presumably from the US Army or US Marine Corps, to be mean to overweight children in the fat camp section of Kamp Krusty. Black mentioned that he had been the president of Euro Krustyland for 15 years until it “blew up” (a parody of the unpopularity of Euro Disneyland).
 Mr. Black is briefly seen drinking brandy, smoking and enjoying a feast with the bullies, making a toast and saying ""Gentlemen, to evil!"" Mr. Black later hires Barney to dress as Krusty in an attempt to keep the campers complacent, but the disguise is poor and Barney spoils the illusion by talking. Bart leads the campers in a revolution to take over the camp. Mr. Black, realizing that he has lost control yells to the bullies, ""To the hydrofoil!"". The drill instructor also leaves Kamp Krusty, either escaping along with Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney and Mr. Black in the hydrofoil or leaving camp grounds by another means, for the fat kids' section is unguarded when Bart frees Martin Prince and the other kids from it. This is the last we ever see of Mr. Black, for he has not reappeared in any subsequent episodes. It is also implied that he had bribed Krusty by offering him ""a dump truck full of money"" in order to get Krusty to sign his name on the camp.
 Mark Kirkland was sure that the character was going to reappear later in the series, but he never did. Al Jean commented ""I guess that the hydrofoil really got Mr. Black out of the show forever.""

 At the pageant sign-ups, Lisa encounters a formidable competitor in the form of Amber Dempsey, a blonde girl with ""eyelash implants"" to make her act more adorable to the judges. After some makeovers at the beauty parlor and encouragement from her family, the day of the pageant arrives. At the introductions, Lisa emphasizes her goals of making Springfield a better place, while Amber catches the adoration of everyone with her eyelashes' blinking. Lisa's talent segment consists of a jazzed-up rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" and ""Proud Mary."" After Krusty's questions with the little girls (where Amber once again relies on her eyelashes), the runner-up is announced as Lisa, and the winner is Amber Dempsey. However, at her first appearance, rain and thunderstorms occur, and a powerful lightning bolt strikes Amber's scepter. She is hospitalized for her injuries, and Lisa takes her place as the acting Little Miss Springfield. 
 Later though, after Lisa figures out the Little Miss Springfield pageant is sponsored by Laramie Tobacco, she starts to rebel, which angers the Laramie Cigarettes company and so the board conspires to strip Lisa of her title and reinstate Amber Dempsey. This is done by means of a technicality when Homer wrote the word ""OK"" in a space marked ""Do not write below this space.""
 Amber recently appears in The Simpsons: Tapped Out as a premium character during the County Fair 2017 mini event, who can be bought along with the Ye Olde Off-Ramp Inn for 150 donuts.

Laura Powers,False,False,False,False,True,4,stars,176,"Laura Powers is a tomboyish teenage girl that moved next door to the Simpsons and the only child of single-parent divorcée Ruth Powers who is understood to be the first crush of Bart Simpson.
 Laura and Ruth Powers (Laura's mother) moved into the house next door when the Winfields moved out. Marge Simpson and Ruth became fast friends; so did Laura and Bart Simpson. After Laura made Bart faint, Bart developed a crush on her, but he later had his heart broken when he found out that she and Jimbo Jones were in a relationship. After Bart prank called Moe's Tavern, Laura chose that Jimbo was no good for her and said that she would date Bart if he were a little older: ""If you had a bad teenage mustache, I'd go out with you in a second."" She then kissed Bart.
 Near the end of the Trappuccino incident, she throws rocks at Homer Simpson when he returns to Springfield and raggedly appears in the crowd alongside her mother upon the climax of the dome's destruction.
 Laura has a tomboyish, laid-back and quick witted charming personality. While outgoing and upbeat, she also displays a great deal of etiquette and manners, from which she owes to a strict and rigorous childhood. Because of her life of sojourning and traveling throughout the world, Laura grew to develop the ability to quickly learn and adapt to her surroundings, and make friends easily through her sociable and easy going nature. Laura also grew to be a prankster and a mild troublemaker akin to Bart, with knowledge how to turn adults away with a polished, polite, and well mannered face, and the simple wisdom that ""the universal language of the wedgie is the quickest way to make friends."" Despite this, it is believed she suffers from family issues due to her parent's divorce, and though she is affable and kind, is somewhat naive of less than wholesome peers seeking to take advantage of her friendship, including how appearances are not all that they seem to be, even if they seem to mesh well with one's preferences.
 Her interests include rebellious quasi-thugs, poking dead bodies with a stick, and messing with people's minds. Her favorite restaurant is ""Two Guys from Kabul."" However, she dislikes authority and disco. Some of her extracurricular activities include babysitting, telling fortunes and dance instructing, being talented enough to teach even infants and cats. Due to being a military brat, she knows over eight languages, including Egyptian, Dutch, Afghani, and Japanese, and to English, even being able to distinguish regional dialects, like Deep South American to British. Her special skill is being able to proudly spitshoot farther than any boy, while her secret shame is enjoying trying on and wearing dresses in light of her tomboy self. 
 Laura Powers has long brown hair and normally wears a white top, black pants, cream-colored sneakers and a green jacket.
 As of Level 54 update on June 17, 2015, Laura Powers appeared in Tapped Out. The way to obtain her is either from The Vault for 150 donuts (40 donuts back) or Yearbook Mystery Box for 30 donuts.

Lyle Lanley,True,False,False,False,False,4,Hartman,178,"Lillard Lewis ""Lyle"" Lanley (possible full name) is a con artist and shyster who sold faulty monorails to several towns, including Springfield.
 The ""marks"" in Lanley's con scheme were towns with a lot of money. Lanley would visit a town and make a sales pitch for his monorails. After the town bought the monorail, Lanley would open a monorail conductor's training school, which was really a farce and provided very little in the way of real training. At the end of the school, Lanley would either select a random student or the least qualified in the class to be the conductor (his exact decision-making method isn't known, but implied to choose a drunk conductor that is least qualified to help cause the accident).
 After the monorail was built and a conductor selected, Lanley would set up a huge opening ceremony with a celebrity presiding, then leave (with the town's money) while everyone's attention was focused on the opening ceremony and the celebrity. The monorail, due to shoddy materials, would typically crash on its first run, causing loss of life and extensive property damage, and leaving the town financially ruined. Meanwhile, Lanley would be living it up on a resort vacation -- bought and paid for with the ""mark"" town's money. However, he was left unaware that there were people whom he could not pull the wool over his eyes; such as one who questioned the concept of a monorail from the start: Marge. Another one Lanley had angered was one of his former contractors: Sebastian Cobb, who regretted working on such a slipshod product when it caused a disaster in North Haverbrook.
 In Springfield, Lyle Lanley interrupted a town meeting when the people were trying to decide how to spend three million dollars the town had collected in fines from Mr. Burns. The town was on the verge of voting to use the money to repair Main Street when Lanley successfully made his sales pitch for the monorail. Lanley then appeared at Springfield Elementary School where he charmed Lisa's class. He seemed surprised that Elizabeth Hoover was a spinster, which won her over. Lisa asked a difficult question as to why mass transit is needed for a community like Springfield, but Lanley managed to win over Lisa as well by playing on her intellect.
 Lanley also opened up a school for the conductor of the monorail, which was in actuality a solitary classroom. Signs of shadiness were first shown when Lanley began his lessons by demanding all investigative reports get out. The only lesson shown was where Lanley said the word monorail stood for ""one rail"", and that was it for the program. Lyle proceeded to walk out the door, until being reminded by Otto Mann that he failed to select a conductor. Lanley considered that an afterthought and opened a notebook where he said he has been intensely monitoring progress. In actuality, the inside of the notebook contained a stick figure of himself driving a truckload of cash to Tahiti, then motioned that Homer Simpson was the star pupil. This seemed to be either a random gesture or that Homer caught Lanley's eye being seated at the front of the class. Marge was concerned about Homer going into such a dangerous profession, and she felt her worries justified when Homer showed the family the bridge of the monorail. When she opened the bay door for the fire extinguisher, she found none, instead a family of possums nesting in that area. She decided to visit Mr. Lanley's trailer, which was unattended. Marge noticed a notebook with crude drawings of the monorail catching fire while a stick figure version of Lanley was absconding with bags of money. Marge was then confronted by Lanley, who demanded to know what she saw. Marge answered ""Nothing incriminating"". Despite being a confidence man, Lanley seemed gullible in that he bought Marge's lie and had no problem with her leaving, then talking to himself ""I don't know why I keep this {the notebook} lying around."" This then inspires Marge to investigate further by driving to North Haverbrook, which was one of the towns Lanley mentioned having previously sold a monorail.
 The monorail opening ceremony featured celebrity guest Leonard Nimoy, who wowed the townspeople by joking that the monorail could do at least Warp Five. Lisa observes Lanley lugging a suitcase full of money into a taxi. She wonders that since Lanley was so promoting of the monorail, shouldn't he join people on its first trip? Lanely rudely told her he had a plane to catch. After the first run started, the monorail's throttle broke and its brakes failed, leaving the monorail speeding out of control. The label for the Springfield Monorail also peeled off, revealing it had been previously been used for the 1964 World's Fair.
 When Marge returns to Springfield with Sebastian Cobb, they and Lisa try to help Homer by using the main control towers for the monorail. However, Homer finds everything to be shoddy, even the brakes. Homer saved the day when Cobb suggests that he uses an anchor. He took the ""M"" from the ""Monorail"" sign and used it as an improvised anchor with a rope, embedding it in a giant metal donut atop a donut shop and stopping the monorail without serious injury to the passengers.
 Lanley, meanwhile, boarded a plane for Tahiti, looking forward to his retirement. His plans went awry, however, when his flight made an unscheduled stop in North Haverbrook, one of his previous monorail ""mark"" towns. Apparently tipped off to Lanley's presence by Marge and/or Cobb, a mob of angry locals stormed the plane and attacked him off-screen. Blows can be heard landing and Lanley was heard screaming as the plane was seen rocking back and forth. Given the fact that Lanley has made no further canonical appearances so far since the comeuppance, not to mention the locals were carrying all manners of lethal weapons like knifes or sickles, it's likely that he was lynched by this mob, if he wasn't handed over to the authorities. 
 The Simpsons later watched a home video of him because they were showing clips of songs and that video contained his song, Monorail.

Sebastian Cobb,True,False,False,False,False,4,Shearer,179,"Sebastian Cobb is a scientist who built North Haverbrook's monorail for Lyle Lanley. After the disastrous monorail accident in North Haverbrook, he helps Marge Simpson stop the monorail that Lyle Lanley sold to Springfield. His speech pattern implies that he may have been raised in Germany and has lived in North Haverbrook for years.
 From the time that Lanley hired him to construct a monorail for North Haverbrook, Cobb suspected foul play. This was proven true when he saw Lanley for the con-artist he really is in cutting costs and building the monorails from cheap, unstable material (rather than spend money to make a monorail from expensive and stable materials).
 When a visiting Marge comes to North Haverbrook, Cobb was the only resident whom was willing to talk to her about the monorail incident. He reveals he was actually against the purchase of the monorail for North Haverbrook and shows her what's left of it. Cobb mentions that the monorail incident is the prime reason why both the investors and most of the residents left for other towns that lead to North Haverbrook's desolate ghost town status. Realizing that Marge knows the truth of Lanley's scams, he assists her in preventing the same accident from happening to Springfield. But along the way, he stopped for a haircut, resulting in them being too late to stop the monorail. He soon came to the control room with Marge and instructed Homer to use an anchor or something strong.
 He has hit by the old monorail in ""The Old Blue Mayor She Ain't What She Used To Be"". However, his death wasn’t confirmed meaning he could have survived.

First episode appearance
""Brother from the Same Planet""


Portrayed by
Phil Hartman


 The Guy that Shines Homer's Shoes Tom is a man from Springfield who temporarily became Bart's ""bigger brother"" aka father.
 After Bart is furious and fed up with Homer's neglect when he forgot about picking him up from soccer, Bart decided to try to get a new father through the Bigger Brothers non-profit organization and is assigned with Tom, who was a F-14 pilot of the U.S. Navy that owns a motorcycle and treated Bart extremely well.
 Eventually, Homer finds out about this and gets his own ""son"" through the organization named Pepi in order to get revenge on Bart. Homer and Tom eventually meet and get into a huge fight. At the end of the fight, Homer bends over a fire hydrant which broke his spine when he took the final blow from Tom, who became utterly shocked of what just happened. Seeing Tom left without a son and Pepi without a father, Bart makes an obvious conclusion by telling them that Tom should become Pepi's father and Pepi should become Tom's son. They agree, and they walk towards the sunset as Tom officially becomes Pepi's father.
 Tom has similar traits to Homer, wearing the same clothes and even shouts ""D'oh"" in frustration. He is generally the antithesis of Homer, taking much better care of himself, has a full head of blonde curly hair and is less slovenly or lackadaisical than Homer.
 Originally, he was going to be voiced by Tom Cruise, but because the staff couldn't get him to perform the role, Phil Hartman was called in to do the voice. This was also when they decided he would be the guy that shines Homer's shoes.

Pepi,True,False,False,False,False,4,MacNeille,181,"Pepi is a poor Spanish boy who temporarily became Homer's son.
 When Bart joins the Bigger Brothers Agency and is assigned to Tom as his temporary father, Homer signs up to the organization to get a temporary son as well in order to get revenge on Bart, and eventually gets Pepi. As Homer is his temporary father, he learns nonsensical things, such as the fact that whales are not mammals or constellations are named after cowboys. 
 Later, after Homer and Tom get into a fight, Homer is sent to the hospital (due to his spine getting cracked when he bends onto a fire hydrant), leaving Pepi to fend for himself. Tom says he has prepared a big meal and it would be a shame for it to go to waste. Pepi says not to mention food as he worries where his next meal will come from. When the two realize they have opposing problems, they simple remark ""bye"" and are about to go their own ways. Bart intervenes, saying Pepi is in more of need of Tom's guidance than himself. Tom then agrees to mentor Pepi as a big brother figure.

Rex Banner,True,False,False,False,False,8,stars,183,"Rex Hugh Banner is the main antagonist in the episode ""Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment"". He is a U.S. Treasury officer in Washington, D.C. who was briefly sent to Springfield to uphold Prohibition in Springfield after Bart got drunk in a live news report, which incited several women to force the city government to declare Prohibition.
 He replaced Clancy Wiggum as Chief of Police and made a main objective to capturing the ""Beer Baron"", a rum-runner who was actually Homer. He also tried interrogating people in regards to who is supplying rum on the side, but his choice of words for his interrogation (Listen, rummy, I'm gonna say it plain and simple. Where'd you pinch the hooch? Is some blind tiger jerking suds on the side?) left one of his interrogatees, Barney Gumble, confused and could only reply with an unsure ""Yes?"". Also, despite being more competent than Wiggum, Banner seems to be somewhat corrupt, as he allowed Fat Tony to smuggle heroin after refusing to take any bribes to smuggle alcohol to Springfield only focusing on their alcohol smuggling. When Homer was finally turned in by Wiggum, Rex was fired, both from his job as chief, and from the main mechanism of punishment for breaking the ancient prohibition law: catapult.  Despite this, he apparently survived, as he later participated in the mob against Homer Simpson.
 Though a very clean cut, non-nonsense officer, he is as effective as Wiggum as police chief beyond him being more ruthless in ensuring prohibition was enforced. Banner was never able to identify Homer as the ""Beer Baron,"" even with overwhelming evidence and Homer's general sloppiness in covering his own tracks, arresting Ned Flanders for being drunk only based on the way he sounds without conducting sobriety tests, stopping the import of beer by building a wall on the road to Springfield, causing several car crashes, and believing the Beer Baron was an invention of the media only because he didn't catch him.
 He apparently maintained contact with his mother via telegram, as a telegram sent to him from his mom, received just shortly after Quimby's telegram requesting his immediate assistance had her tell him that her dog Daisy had just given birth to a litter of puppies.
 Tapped Out Rex Banner was based on Eliot Ness, the Treasury agent who led the famous Prohibition-enforcement team ""The Untouchables"". His voice is based on Robert Stack's portrayal of Ness in the Untouchables TV series, while his appearance is based on Kevin Costner's portrayal of Ness in the Untouchables film.

Dr. Wolfe,True,False,False,False,False,4,Azaria,185,"He is known for being able to tell when people are lying, and will vehemently call them out on it. He informs Marge that Lisa needs braces, at exactly the same time that Mr. Burns revokes Homer's dental plan. Unable to pay for good braces, Dr. Wolfe gives Lisa a set that ""predate stainless steel"". However, Wolfe is notably horrified as soon as the procedure was completed at what he gave Lisa, remaining speechless when Lisa demands for the mirror twice, handing it to her after she demands the mirror the second time around, and backs away in fear as Lisa starts laughing maniacally in a brief loss of her sanity and smashes the mirror to pieces when she sees the new braces. In the end, Homer gets the dental plan.
 Dr. Wolfe is last seen laughing about leaving the gas on, and the rest of the family (along with Dr. Wolfe) collapse as a result of inhaling too much. While he has not been seen since, Marge later discovered that he was not actually a qualified orthodontist, but a rogue periodontist, requiring Lisa to get braces again.
 Anthony Perkins had agreed to voice Dr. Wolfe, but unfortunately fell ill and could not record the part. Clint Eastwood and Anthony Hopkins had also been asked to provide a voice, but both declined.
Dr. Wolfe's reaction to the aftermath of the procedure, as well as the scene itself, spoofed the aftermath of Jack Napier's botched reconstructive surgery in the 1989 Batman movie.

Gremlin (character),True,False,False,False,False,5,stars,187,"It was voiced by Frank Welker who also did the voices of the gremlins Stripe and Mohawk from the Gremlins franchise.
 Bart had a dream one night where the school bus lost a wheel and crashed. The next day, whilst on the bus, Bart finds a gremlin on the side. The Gremlin is attempting to destroy the bus by gouging the side and removing the bolts from the tires, so that they would fall off. Bart tries to tell everyone, but the Gremlin hid, and everyone else assumed Bart was crazy. Bart decided to take matters into his own hands by throwing a flare at the Gremlin. This knocked the Gremlin off the bus, where he was found by Ned Flanders. Flanders remarked ""it's some kind of hideous monster... Aw, isn't that cute. He's trying to claw my eyes out.""
 Although he was proved to be right about the monster, Bart is still taken away in an ambulance to a mental asylum as a punishment for being disruptive. Later Bart assumes that everything is okay, but the Gremlin shows up at back of the ambulance's window holding Ned's severed head.

Bobby Peterson,True,False,False,False,False,5,Azaria,188,"Robert Peterson (or Bobby) is the Dean of Springfield University. He prefers to be called ""Bobby"".
 Bobby is a young go-getter—very mellow, hip, and easy-going. He used to play bass guitar for The Pretenders and he encourages the Springfield University students to call him by his first name. Bobby is also very much not a hard-nosed disciplinarian, but is willing to take the blame for being too strict if disciplinary issues arise at the university. In fact, Bobby had never expelled anybody from school, prior to kicking out Benjamin, Doug and Gary for kidnapping Sir Oinks-A-Lot. Even then, Bobby only did it because of the influence of the pig's powerful friends (such as Richard Nixon).
 In spite of Bobby's positive qualities, Homer Simpson takes an instant dislike to him, and spends most of his time at Springfield University nurturing an unreasonable resentment for the dean. Due to watching bad college comedy movies such as School of Hard Knockers, Homer has a stereotypical image of a college dean as an inflexible old fuddy-duddy. This persists in Bobby's case, even though Homer is several years older than Bobby.
 But when Homer becomes remorseful for his part in getting the nerds expelled while he himself got off scot-free, he confesses everything to the dean: kidnapping Sir Oinks-A-Lot, hitting the dean with his car (in a gone-awry scheme to get the nerds re-admitted to school), and the other pranks he and the nerds pulled. Bobby, for his part, concedes that he may have been ""a bit of an ogre"" and rescinds the nerds' expulsions, although as a result of being hit by Homer's car, he apparently needed a new hip, given what Dr. Hibbert mentioned. After that, Bobby and Homer get along reasonably well, partying together and even teaming up to prank Richard Nixon and Springfield A&amp;M.
 After Homer's time at college, Bobby is present at a man's execution. At some point afterwards, during Homer's college reunion, Homer decided to pull a prank on Dean Peterson involving a bucket with glue on the bottom and an ajar door as revenge for forcing him to donate. However, the plan backfired when it turned out that someone else set up the prank bucket, causing it to fall on Homer's head.

Mindy Simmons,False,False,False,False,False,5,stars,190,"Mindy Simmons was an employee of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. She likes the same things as Homer, such as donuts. When Homer met her at work, he found himself highly attracted to her because she was practically a female version of himself.
 Mindy has long slightly wavy orange hair and wears red lipstick. She wears a blue tie, a light blue long-sleeve shirt, darker blue jeans, and pink high heels. She is noted for having a curvy figure despite her eating habits and dislike for exercise.
 When Charlie complained to Mr. Burns about failure to comply with safety procedures, Burns used a pneumatic tube to send him away to a land populated by cackling men wearing turbans. Charlie's return to the States would be a long time coming and a replacement was needed. Mr. Burns was also under political pressure to have at least one female employee on the roll, so he hired Mindy Simmons. Homer immediately developed a crush on his beautiful and very sexy new co-worker, which freaked him out.
 At Barney's advice, he decided to get to know Mindy, thinking their attraction was simply a physical one. However, this made things worse as Homer quickly discovered that they shared many similarities, such as a fondness for beer, junk food and TV.
 Mindy was equally attracted to Homer, who went to great lengths to try to avoid her, but they kept bumping into each other. Homer tried calling a crisis hotline, but ended up confessing to Ned Flanders, who against privacy went to call Marge and tell her. Homer panicked, fell over and was knocked unconscious.
 During this time, he was visited by his guardian angel, first taking the form of Isaac Newton, then Colonel Klink, who showed him how terrible his life would be if he left Marge and married Mindy, but this plan backfired when it was shown Homer and Mindy would be incredibly wealthy and very happily married, and Marge would be the President of the United States.
 Eventually, Homer decided to just tell Mindy that due to their attraction, they should avoid each other from there on, but Mr. Burns mistook their awkward conversation for one between close friends, and selected them to represent the nuclear power plant at the National Energy Convention in Capital City, staying at the Capital City Plaza Hotel.
 Throughout the entire stay, Homer was very tempted to enter into an affair with her (and felt compelled to by a fortune cookie which said that he was going to find happiness with a new love), and the more time they spent together, the more they fell for one another, even accidentally kissing when sharing a foot-long chilli dog.
 After a romantic dinner (the prize for winning the Convention), they went back to Homer's hotel room, where Homer confesses his feelings to Mindy, and how confused he is as he loves Marge as well.
 Mindy assures Homer he doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to, and it's up to him how far their relationship will go. After thinking about it, Homer decides to stay faithful to Marge. Mindy understands and accepts his decision, and she and Homer share a chaste kiss before she leaves.
 Later, Mindy joined a bowling league team called the The Home Wreckers, and went to Green Day's funeral. She was also seen in The Twisted World Of Marge Simpson waiting to buy from Fleet-A-Pita.
 
After Homer turned Mindy down, she ""hit the bottle pretty hard"" and was fired from the nuclear power plant. However, her name appears on the Softball Sign-Up Sheet on the bulletin board in ""He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs"".  Homer tries to avoid Mindy. She was then seen in ""Mountain of Madness"" episode, only as a background character.
 She has also been seen in a more recent episode ""The D'oh-cial Network"" but only in the background.
 Mindy seen in the episode ""D'ohical Network"" or Season 23, Episode 11. Mindy was also released in The Simpsons: Tapped Out with the Valentine's Day 2014 Event.
 Mindy has been seen at the power plant in ""Undercover Burns"", even though she was presumed to be fired. This episode may have taken place, prior to her being fired.
 She also appeared on a mural in ""Now Museum, Now You Don't"".
 Mindy is the female equivalent of Homer: She likes cheeseburgers, a quick nap before lunch, foot-long chili dogs, whipped cream straight from the can, raspberry swirl doughnuts with a double glaze, drinking Duff beer, watching TV, and roasted anything. When Homer and Mindy were in a cramped elevator together, Homer tried to think about unsexy thoughts to keep his mind off her, and when he opened his eyes, she was doing the same thing about him. Mindy also has a tendency to drool like Homer when thinking about food and even uses his ""Mmm..."" catchphrase. The only difference between the two of them is that despite her overindulgent ways, Mindy (mysteriously) has a slim and attractive figure, contrasted with Homer's overweight appearance. In fact, Mindy could be described as a more attractive version of Abbey due to them both being very similar to Homer.
 Homer accidentally knocked himself unconscious while grappling with the dilemma of his attraction to Mindy. A spirit, in the form of Colonel Klink from Hogan's Heroes, showed Homer the ""disaster"" of what would have happened if he left Marge and married Mindy. They would have been extremely wealthy and Marge would have been the President of the United States.
 Michelle Pfeiffer provided the voice of Mindy Simmons in the episode ""The Last Temptation of Homer"". In one scene in the episode, Mindy drools as she eats doughnuts, much like Homer does. To get the right drool sound, she had to put broccoli and water in her mouth.
 Many scenes in the animatic portrayed Mindy as flirty. David Mirkin did not like this because the secret of the episode was Homer and Mindy are two good people who are thrown into the situation and ""can't help that their libidos are going crazy upon seeing each other"". He added that the two characters have ""so much in common"" that it is ""not just a physical relationship, but a mental connection as well"", and that Mindy is not a seductress but rather a woman just as nervous as Homer. Mirkin also pointed out that while Homer is being tempted by a ""seemingly perfect"" woman at work, his wife could not be more ""imperfect"" since she has a cold and looks sickly, during the same episode. ""He's trying to connect with his family, but with Marge being ill and Bart looking like a nerd, everything is just not working"", Mirkin said.

Stacy Lovell,False,False,False,False,False,5,stars,192,"Stacey Lovell is the creator of the Malibu Stacy franchise.
 She is the creator of the Malibu Stacy dolls and is the founder of the franchise. Lovell explained to Lisa Simpson that she was forced out of the company in 1974; Lovell tells Lisa that the reason she was forced out of the company was because the executives claimed that her ""way of thinking wasn't 'cost-effective.'"" (Which is ultimately proven true due to her admitting under her breath that producing the Lisa Lionheart doll at all costs $46,000.) However, it's implied that the real reason Lovell was forced out of the company was because she was funneling profits to the Vietcong in Vietnam (essentially committing treason against the United States and more-or-less getting away with it).
 Lisa bikes to Stacy Lovell's house (built exactly like Malibu Stacy's dream house), she says she wants Miss Lovell to hear what Stacy is telling a generation of young girls.
 Lisa and Stacy decide to create a new talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself and complete with her own encouraging phrases. The doll is quietly released, and even Kent Brockman (at the request of his daughter), spends his whole newscast talking about the doll, ignoring breaking news that the President was arrested for murder. However, the creators of Malibu Stacy view Lisa's doll as a real threat, and plan to sink Lisa Lionheart. 
 Stacy Lovell and Lisa On the day the doll is officially released, numerous young girls (and Smithers) rush into the toy store at the Springfield Mall to buy Lisa Lionheart. As Lisa and Stacy Lovell watch, a cart of ""new"" Malibu Stacy dolls with a new hat is wheeled right into the path of the group running for the Lisa display. Lisa appeals to them that it's just the same doll with a new hat, but they all prefer to stick with Malibu Stacy (largely due to a phrase from Smithers, ""but she's got a new hat!"") ...except for one little girl, who leaves with a Lisa Lionheart doll. Lisa remarks that even though they didn't sell out of the dolls, they at least managed to get through to one little girl. Stacy agrees, and mutters under her breath, 'Particularly if that that little girl happens to pay $46,000 for that doll,' suggesting her gloomy outlook on the financial success of the venture (and more-or-less confirming the executives' claim that her ideas were not cost-effective).
 She lives in her own house, and is also the ""Ego-Destroying Control Freak"" type of mom you meet at the PTA.

Race Banyon,True,False,False,False,False,5,Azaria,193,"Race Banyon is an astronaut who flies on the space shuttle with Buzz Aldrin and Homer Simpson.
 Banyon is part of a shuttle mission where NASA is trying to improve their image by sending an average Joe (Homer) into space. Banyon is one of the minor characters in the series but he is still a big fellow. Banyon is generally impatient and condescending towards Homer. When an emergency develops during the mission and it looks like they all are going to die, Banyon declares that he is taking Homer to hell with him.
 It is possible Banyon's name was influenced by a Jonny Quest character and Pace Mannion, who played six years in the NBA for several teams.

Freddy Quimby,True,False,False,False,False,5,Castellaneta,194,"Frederick ""Freddy"" Joey Quimby is the nephew of Springfield's mayor, Joe Quimby. He was the first character introduced as a villain, but later reformed after false accusations.
 Freddy was first featured in the episode “The Boy Who Knew Too Much”, in which he was charged with beating up a French waiter. (In actuality, the French waiter almost killed himself due to his clumsiness, with Freddy Quimby having absolutely nothing to do with it, and even his incriminating words, ""All right, you asked for it! I'm gonna enjoy this!"", were actually in reference to a champagne bottle that he chose to drink rather than use for battery). The court ruled in favor of Freddy because Bart Simpson testified with an eyewitness account.
 Freddy was also seen in a nonspeaking role in the next episode “Trash of the Titans” when Homer barges ahead of him in line in order to file papers to run for office, but then realizes that Freddy is among those in line who have to register as sex offenders. Freddy also once owned a Fish Stick Factory before Mayor Quimby fired his own nephew and took over the production himself. He is seen appearing briefly in “See Homer Run” with an altered appearance and improved look, and with a different voice. (Apparently, he started becoming somewhat of a law-abiding citizen, as he is like his press secretary, and as evidenced in the town hall meeting that started the recall elections, he seemed willing to even call out his uncle for the crimes that he and his administration caused.)
 Like most characters surrounding Joe Quimby, Freddy Quimby is intended to be a satire of the famous Kennedy family political dynasty. The character's name is in homage to Fred Quimby, the producer of many 1940s and early 1950s shorts of Tom and Jerry.
 Note: Most of his appearances are brief, background roles, episodes where he has a speaking role are in bold.

Jessica Lovejoy,False,False,False,False,False,6,stars,197,"Jessica Lovejoy is the rebellious daughter of Reverend Lovejoy and Helen Lovejoy. She is Bart Simpson's biggest crush after Laura Powers and first girlfriend as well. She was featured as both Bart Simpson's love interest and the main antagonist of ""Bart's Girlfriend"".
 While appearing sweet and calm on the outside, Jessica actually has a penchant for mischief and chaos and can cross the line farther than Bart himself, despite her being raised by very religious parents. Among boys smitten by her, she falls right into the role of femme fatale and isn't afraid to use it. She has been portrayed as having the ability to draw young boys under her spell; one, a library assistant, rode on a bicycle to pick her up as she hoodwinked Bart into cleaning the church steps in her stead. She uses her beauty to manipulate boys and uses timidity to manipulate adults and girls.
 Jessica went to a boarding school but was allegedly expelled for vandalism of school property including toilets, supposedly with a pipe bomb, and stealing from the school collection plate. After her expulsion, she briefly dated Bart Simpson. According to Bart's experiences with her, Jessica encouraged his negative behaviour and eventually pushed him down an extremely steep hill littered with truck accidents on his skateboard. Later, Jessica went as far as to activate the fire alarm at Springfield Elementary during the school day as a prank, causing mass panic at the school. It is stated (by Bart) that she has an IQ of 108, and that ""she's like a Milk Dud; sweet on the outside, poison on the inside."" She inevitably went too far, however, by stealing the collection money from the First Church of Springfield (where her father is a minister) and framing Bart by leaving the plate on his lap. Lisa, however, brought her to justice. After showing the evidence that Jessica is bad, her father actively ignores the fact that his daughter is a criminal and continues to blame the theft on Bart until Jessica finally admits to her crime. Later, Bart is once again taken in by her charms as he works to scrub clean the church steps (a punishment meant for Jessica) while she rides off on a date with another boy, one unidentified (yet allegedly well-read) library volunteer, but comes to do a sub-par job on the steps to punish her further.
 Despite the fact that she's a wicked, misbehaving, antisocial girl, she does try to get attention from her father, who is shown to ignore and deny her behavioral problems. She also explains that her behavior, in part, is because of her desire for attention from her father.
 Jessica has since made cameos throughout the series. She and her father were participants in Robot Rumble. Their creation, a centipede-like machine by the name of Kill-a-Puss, was defeated by ""Chief Knock-A-Homer"", Homer and Bart's entry. Jessica makes a cameo appearance as a player in a soccer game where she gets the ball past Sherri and Terri. However, she is unfairly accused of committing a foul when Lisa unsuccessfully attempts to get the ball from her and trips. She was also taken to Weasel Island by her father on Mother's Day. When SpringFace was introduced to Springfield, she became one of Lewis' online friends. She then appeared in a photo that Bart kept alongside the photos of his other past girlfriends. It can be assumed that Bart actually didn't visit Jessica, unlike the rest of his ex-girlfriends, because of what happened between them during their relationship. She also appears in The Simpsons Movie sitting in the front row at church when Reverend Lovejoy says, ""Lord hear our prayer.""
 Jessica also appears in the new opening sequence, playing the flute in the school's music class.
 In the video game The Simpsons: Tapped Out, Jessica is a premium character and appears in various storylines. She is also possibly revealed to have framed Gina Vendetti for attempted murder when she confesses to it in the quest A Krusty Reunion.
 Jessica has long straight black hair with bangs and a thick non-receding hairline. She usually wears pink and purple outfits. She also has high cheekbones, large dimples and eyelashes of unusually long length. Her usual outfit consists of a pink headband with a bow in her hair, a pink dress, a light purple T-shirt, and white socks with purple pumps.
 Jessica is an expert troublemaker, but yet sweet, calm, beautiful, and honest girl to the point where even Nelson Muntz thinks she's innocent. As a reckless prankster, she gets along well with Bart to an extent. Putting on a front, she gets away with her crimes. Her disregard for social norms, rules, and obligations gets other people in problematic situations. She doesn't listen to anyone and is prone to putting people on edge. She is also an adrenaline junkie, attracted to risks and dangers. She has a passion for skateboards, motorcycles and snowboards. She mocks her father behind his back. She has such a fiery determination to ignore rules that even Bart Simpson thought she was going too far. She also smokes on occasion. But she shows an emotionally vulnerable side of herself after she admits she did her misdeeds out of desire for attention from her father.
 Note: Most of her appearances are brief, background roles. The episode in which she has a star role is in bold.

Ashley Grant,False,False,False,False,False,6,Hayden,198,"Ashley Grant is a graduate student and feminist. She also works as a babysitter, presumably to help pay for graduate school or as a stipend to offset costs of being a student.
 Ashley babysat Bart, Lisa, and Maggie while Homer and Marge attended the Springfield Candy Convention. When Homer drove Ashley home and she got out of the car, he noticed his misplaced Gummi Venus de Milo stuck to the seat of her pants and picked it off. Ashley misinterpreted this as sexual harassment and ran off screaming, and she returned to the Simpson house the next morning with sign-carrying protesters denouncing Homer's behavior. This caused problems for Homer until Groundskeeper Willie showed everyone a video which proved that Homer did not touch Ashley but was only retrieving the Gummi Venus. Shown this proof, Ashley dropped her harassment accusation against Homer, and admitted that she had been wrong about him. She said that although she originally considered Homer to be an animal, she had to believe Lisa's insistence that Homer was a decent man - with Homer claiming they were both right.
 Ashley got along well with Lisa and Maggie, as Lisa admired her for her feminist stance. Bart, on the other hand, loathed her, as he was hoping that their babysitter would be a scary-looking hobo instead of her and called her a maniac due to her stance, but she demonstrated that she knew how to manipulate men and boys when she used a violent video game to persuade Bart to do housework and to make him walk into a wall.

First episode appearance
""Treehouse of Horror VII""


Portrayed by
Nancy Cartwright


 Hugo Simpson II (born April 1, 1979 or February 23, 1979) is a possible non-canon character and Bart's conjoined twin in ""Treehouse of Horror VII"". Shortly after their birth, they were separated by Dr. Hibbert. Since then, he has yet to make another appearance.
 Siamese/conjoined twins Hugo and Bart Bart, Lisa, and Maggie discovered Hugo after they heard strange sounds coming from the attic and after Homer spilled the beans about there being four Simpson children. As the ""evil and cruel twin"", Hugo had been confined to living in the attic of the Simpson home and once a week was given a bucket of fish heads to eat because he was the evil and cruel one. Hugo also did experimental surgery to prepare for his eventual reattachment to the beautiful Bart and created a ""Pigeon-Rat"" in the process. The family later learned, however, that Bart was actually the evil and cruel twin, as Hugo's scar from when he and Bart separated was on the wrong side, mostly on the left side of his body. Bart then took Hugo's place in the attic and was fed fish heads, while Hugo moved downstairs to live with the family. Bart was let back down with the family after the dinner scene with Hugo sitting at the table.
 In this 2003 video game, Hugo is one of the character costumes for Bart.
 During the 2014 Halloween Event of the app-based game, Hugo was one of the craft prizes and had his own questline. He also returns in the 2015 Halloween Event.
 In the first quest line, The Good Son, Homer mentions that despite his weird features, he still thinks of him like a son, which Hugo, understandably, is insulted by this, reminding Homer that he is, in fact, his son, being Bart's conjoined twin brother. Homer then offered to take Hugo out to Krusty Burger, although he declined, citing he's been on a strict diet of fish-heads, though he does offer to share his supply with Homer for dinner due to having extra. However, Homer skipped out of dinner, and ate chicken instead, causing Hugo to suspect that he's embarrassed by his presence. He also offered to walk Pigeon-Rat, viewing him as his only friend due to believing his family was embarrassed about his existence, although his ""friend"" actually didn't want to be seen with him either. Eventually, Marge and Homer apologized to him, and admitted that they were embarrassed in part due to his status as the evil twin, although Hugo is quick to remind him that he's, in fact, the good twin, which is apparently something the family, in particular, Homer, keeps on forgetting, with Bart inferring it's due to Homer's overall idiocy. Hugo then privately believes all families have evil twins, and plans on trying to find his own place in the future.
 In the second quest line, Bart is made to deliver the fish food upstairs by his parents (implied to be because Bart spoiled Homer's job by discovering Hugo in the first place, even though it was by that point established that Hugo and Bart's actual statuses were mixed up). Hugo then lets Bart have some of the fish, with Bart complaining about how things are going, before Hugo reminds him about how his own life was objectively worse. Hugo then offers to switch places with Bart for the time being, with Bart agreeing. Marge and Homer noticed this, with Marge worrying about it being cliched, although Homer was more apathetic, citing that it either is permanent or they grow tired of it. Hugo then decides to take a walk as his first act of being in Bart's shoes, while Bart likewise looked forward to trying to claw the attic and make sinful abominations in Hugo's stead. Similar to before, Hugo also asks Pigeon-Rat how it feels to be free, completely oblivious to the fact that his ""friend"" wants to get away from him and his stench. Hugo and Bart then talk about their day thus far, and both made clear they had a great day, with Bart merging Malibu Stacey and Radioactive Man, with Hugo complimenting him. Although Bart acknowledges that Hugo's the good twin, he's surprised he's willing to use live subjects since that's cruel, but Hugo indicates that he, or at least, he thought, Pigeon-Rat wanted to be spliced together (although they insist otherwise in their language). He then heads off to school, although his time there was less than pleasant, as none of the kids want to eat with him due to his meal and his more grotesque appearance, and even Skinner, who had otherwise taken offense to their implying that he gave them permission to be cruel, was overall disgusted with him. Hugo then returned home, only to find Bart very eager to reunite them surgically, ironically like what he nearly did to Bart earlier, causing him to beg for his parent's help before Homer told them to shut up. Hugo ultimately decided to live back in the attic, thinking it was ultimately better there than the outside world after witnessing how cruel people can be, with Bart agreeing.

Dr. Zweig,False,False,False,False,False,6,stars,201,"Dr. Zweig is a psychologist who helps Marge overcome her fear of flying.
 After Marge discovers that she has a fear of flying, Marge decides to get some professional help. She goes to Dr. Zweig (who Homer fears will blame all Marge's problems on him) who charges Marge 30 dollars an hour. The doctor dives deep into Marge's psyche and discovers that the fact that her father was a male flight attendant is to blame, and just as she is about to start discussing Marge's husband, Homer runs in and pulls her away. Dr. Zweig is typically calm, but becomes especially passionate when describing that the Monkees symbolized rebellion and when she discovers that Marge's cheque bounced. Despite all the help, Marge thinks Zweig's name is ""Lowenstein""; the false assumption about Zweig's name may also explain why Marge would write a bad cheque to Zweig.
 As Marge begins to delve into her deepest psyche, Dr. Zweig minimizes it by snapping, ""Yes, yes, it's all a rich tapestry!"" 
 Zweig's voice actor Anne Bancroft's real life husband Mel Brooks, who would later guest star the same season in Homer vs. Patty and Selma, was on set when Fear of Flying was made and attempted to dictate show-runner David Mirkin's production advice.https://books.google.com/books?id=7qAuDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=mel+brooks+fear+of+flying+i+can%27t+get+rid+of+him&amp;pg=PA153 Mel's behavior when the episode was being produced may have been the inspiration for Zweig's line 'You know, Marge, we've really just begun to scratch the surface.

Guy Incognito,True,False,False,False,False,6,Castellaneta,202,"Guy Incognito is a man who is Homer's doppelganger, with the exception of a brown mustache. It is evident he has never met or heard of Homer Simpson, but his uncanny resemblance had gotten him into trouble.
 It is unknown where Guy lives, though his appearance and manner of speaking suggest he is an English foreigner.
 Guy Incognito had the misfortune to visit Moe's Tavern right after Homer had been banned from the establishment. Guy walked in and politely ordered a drink. His speech resembled a poor American imitation of a foreign accent, and he had the look of Homer Simpson in disguise with a fake mustache.
 
Observant of Guy's uncanny similarity to Homer, and apparently not convinced by his awkward accent, Moe understandably addressed him as ""Homer"" and told him to leave. Guy asked, ""Who is Homer?"" and introduced himself as Guy Incognito. Now totally unconvinced by his name and persona, Moe and his customers beat Guy up and tossed him outside knocking him out cold. Homer happened to be walking by and was astounded to see his exact double, but was then quickly distracted by a dog with a puffy tail. Guy Incognito has a mustache and is a snappier dresser than Homer is. His voice is identical to Homer's, and he speaks with a slow, labored English accent.
 Guy Incognito's name is a double play on words: ""Guy"" is a colloquial term for a person whose name isn't known, and ""incognito,"" which literally means ""unknown,"" is a term referring to a person who is in disguise to keep from being recognized. Consequently, when Guy introduces himself to Moe as ""Guy Incognito,"" from Guy's resemblance to Homer, Moe quickly but incorrectly concludes that it's Homer trying to sneak back into the bar.

Number One,True,False,False,False,False,6,stars,203,"Number One Elias J. Drayton, better known as Number One, is the head of the Stonecutters.
 Not much is known about Number One, except that he is a loyal Stonecutter and rose above the ranks to lead the Springfield chapter. He gleefully subjects new recruits to tortures such as ""the crossing of the desert"", ""the unblinking eye"" and ""the paddling of the swollen ass... with paddles"". He also enjoys presiding over the club's many social gatherings, which include things like ping-pong, ribs, and plenty of beer. His day job is a security guard at Star Trek Museum.
 During his senior year of high school, the teen who became Number One was informed by his guidance councilor that the job he was best suited for was leader of an ancient mystical society. During his reign, Number One was beloved by his fellow Stonecutters and a time of peace, prosperity, and ping-pong prevailed.
 Number One oversaw Homer's initiation into the Stonecutters, but then expelled him for desecrating the club's sacred parchment (by using it as a napkin and blowing his nose on it). When Homer was later discovered to be the prophesied ""Chosen One"" of the Stonecutters, Number One quickly conducted the appropriate ceremonies for Homer's new status. However, Homer made changes which made the club no longer any fun for the other members due to their misinterpretation of his good intentions as going mad with power. Number One then disbanded the Stonecutters and started a new club called ""The Ancient Mystic Society of No Homers"".
 Number One in the comics In the Simpsons Super Spectacular story, ""The Piemen of the World!"", the Simpson family encounter Number One and members of the Stonecutters at the Springfield Arts Museum, who had just stolen the Stone of Attack as part of his final piece for world domination. As soon as he orders his minions to attack the people in the museum, Homer and Bart as Pieman and Cupcake Kid leap into action and thwart his attack. However, before they could finish him off, Homer is interrupted by The Piemen of the World, allowing the Stonecutters time to make a quick getaway.
 According to the Piemen of the World, the Stonecutters are an evil group who created a pie from a rock centuries ago. This pie would be known as the Stone Pie, which would turn into the Pie of All Power, once its mystic powers matured. This led to the creation of the Piemen of the World, for the sake of fighting this threat. After the Stonecutters' first defeat by the Piemen, each member took a piece of the pie and escaped. Sometime later, they apparently seized Pie Island for their own headquarters.
 Patrick Stewart, who voiced Number One, is considered one of the best short-term guest stars in the show's history, both by the show's producers and the fans. Stewart's most famous character, Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation, indeed calls his First Officer, William Riker, 'Number One'.

Hugh Parkfield,True,False,False,False,False,6,,208,"Hugh St. John Alastair Parkfield is a famous one-time character of The Simpsons. He was voiced by Mandy Patinkin and appeared in the Emmy-winning episode ""Lisa's Wedding"".
 He is a British student who becomes engaged to Lisa 15 years in the future, but after he insulted her family, she breaks their engagement off.
 In the future, 23-year-old Lisa becomes annoyed by Hugh and at first, the two quarrel over a book in the library, but the pair eventually fall madly in love.
 The two discover they have a lot in common and Hugh invites Lisa to come back to his home in England so she can meet his parents.
 Hugh asks Lisa to marry him and she immediately accepts. Lisa and Hugh travel to Springfield where Lisa is worried that her family will embarrass her and things get off to a bad start when Bart and Homer accidentally set the British Union Jack flag on fire, which they put out by throwing compost onto it.
 At dinner, Lisa plans on going for a wedding dress fitting and Homer decides to take Hugh out on the town to Moe's Tavern. While there, Homer presents Hugh with a tacky pair of cuff links (a bride and groom pig) that all Simpsons men have worn on their wedding day, asking him to continue the tradition; Hugh reluctantly agrees to wear them during the wedding.
 Later that night, Lisa apologizes profusely for the behavior of her family and although Hugh says it was nothing, he stays up thinking. On the day of the wedding, Homer talks with Lisa and she discovers that Hugh did not wear Homer's cuff links.
 She finds Hugh and asks him to wear them. He agrees, but lets slip that after the wedding he plans for them to return to England and never see her family again. Lisa is outraged and calls off the wedding.
 Back in the present once more, the fortune teller says that Hugh went back to England and never saw Lisa again and that there was nothing Lisa could do to prevent it - although she should ""try to look surprised"".
 Lisa questions the fortune teller about her ""true love"" and the fortune teller reveals that although Lisa will have a true love, she ""specializes in foretelling relationships where you get jerked around.""
 Lisa leaves the booth and finds her father, who brags about his day at the fair, and Lisa listens raptly as the two walk off, undoubtedly grateful to Homer after she saw what his future self had done for her.

Shelby,True,False,False,False,False,6,MacNeille,209,"Grandfather: Shelbyville Abe His friends are Milhouse, the first, second, third, and fourth unnamed boy.
 At the Springfield Lemon Tree, after Bart mentions that Springfield is a nice place to live in, Shelby immediately remarks that Springfield sucks. After in an exchange of insults between the Springfield boy and the Shelbyville boys, Shelby and his gang try to steal their lemons, only to be pelted by them in return. Shelby vows to get back at them and steals their lemon tree.
 When Bart tries to retrieve the lemon tree by going incognito, the Shelbyville boys put him to the test by making him spray paint ""Springfield Sucks"" on top of the Shelbyville Bluffs. After first, Bart spray paints what he tells him, but he actually paints ""Springfield Rules Suckers"", and reveals himself to the boys. Before Shelby and his gang can beat him up, Bart distracts them by telling them there's someone's attractive cousin. After Bart swipes one of the Shelbyville children's skateboards to make a getaway, Shelby proceeds on his skateboard to catch him, leading to an all-out chase around Shelbyville.
 While Bart accidentally hides out in the Tiger Feeding Area at the Shelbyville Zoo, Shelby and his gang almost catch up to him, before Bart picks the right door to escape through. Later on, Shelby is later seen making lemonade, while his friends ride motorbikes around the lemon tree. Shelby is last seen helping his father close the impound lot gate to prevent the Springfield boys and their fathers from getting away with the lemon tree tied on top of Ned Flanders' RV, only for them to shake their fists in anger as they get away.
 He looks similar to Bart, with the exception of his hair, his pants, and the color of his hat. He also has a best friend named Milhouse and a similarly dim-witted, balding father like Homer. He is arguably smarter than Bart as evidenced by his quote, ""You just got citric acid in my eye!"" However, he falls short in the name-calling department, having been handily out-insulted by Bart in the first encounter near the lemon tree.

 Professor Sally Wexler is a therapist. Milhouse often calls her when he has a problem.
 She is first mentioned in the season 7 episode Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming when Milhouse is in the plane’s cockpit.
 When Milhouse Van Houten calls her to ask her to help Bart, she tells him to stop calling her because she is on her honeymoon. She later called him a creepy boy.

He wears a blue, short sleeved dress shirt with a tag that read “SECURITY”, a green tie, brown slacks, and brown shoes. Brodka is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, as he is seen with a tattoo on his upper arm that reads ""USMC"" and has the eagle, globe and anchor emblem of the Corps. He is a heavy cigarette smoker with a gruff voice and surly demeanor. Brodka is somewhat crude as he tells Bart, ""If I wanted smoke blown up my ass, I'd be at home with a pack of cigarettes and short length of hose."" He eats Handi-Snacks (small packages of crackers with spreadable cheese) at his work desk and tends to confuse the Ten Commandments.   
 The writers reportedly planned to have Don Brodka appear in future episodes. However, the idea was scrapped after Lawrence Tierney died in 2002. (This also happened in the case of Larry Burns who was voiced by Rodney Dangerfield who died in 2004). Don Brodka is later seen only as a background character in 22 Short Films About Springfield. He is also seen as one of many other Springfield residents who laugh at Nelson. During Trappuccino, he joined the angry mob that wanted Homer dead for dumping in Lake Springfield.

Chester J. Lampwick,True,False,False,False,False,7,stars,214,"Chester J. Lampwick is the original creator of Itchy, and father of cartoon violence.
 Chester &amp; Bart eating sandwiches In 1919, he made the first Itchy cartoon, entitled ""Itchy the Lucky Mouse in 'Manhattan Madness'"". Roger Meyers, Sr. stole the idea from him and refused to pay him. Chester then became a bum for many years until he and Bart Simpson opened up a case against Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios for $800 billion. Chester and Bart won the case, making Chester incredibly wealthy. With his earnings, he bought a solid gold house and a rocket car. The payout to Chester from the studio lead to its downfall, so Bart and Lisa went to Chester to ask him to fund Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios. When Lisa tried to convince him to do so by telling him he'd get royalties, Chester replied, ""I don't need any more money. I'm not greedy. As long as I've got my health, my millions of dollars, my gold house, and my rocket car, I don't need anything else."" Lisa then says, ""Yes, but..."" and is then interrupted by Chester saying, ""Not interested."" He then proceeds to go to sleep.
 Chester has grudges against both Abe Simpson and Krusty the Clown. His grudge with Abe dates back to 1947 when Abe hired Chester to paint his chicken coop in exchange for a plate of corn muffins. Likewise, Krusty hired Chester to paint his fence in exchange for some blintzes. In both cases, Chester reneged on the deal because the food was ""lousy"" and got in a fistfight when he saw former of his former employers and refused to do the work he was hired to do, and the latter of his former employers nearly attacked him at Chester's goading during court before the judge intervened. It was the aforementioned squabble between Abe and Chester that ultimately forced Homer to agree to pay for Chester's lawsuit at Bart's request (or rather, Homer being forced to adhere to Marge's stipulation that he evict Chester) due to his initially not wanting to pay for it.
 During the events in ""Trappuccino"", Chester could be seen in the angry mob searching for his former allies. He could be seen wearing his bum clothes, indicating that he probably lost his fortune. However, a Simpsons comic reveals that he misses the life of being a hobo.
 Even though he is the father of cartoon violence, Chester himself seems like a nice enough man on first appearances. However, he has spent so long as a bum that he has difficulty viewing the world from any other perspective. When the Simpson family help him win back his vast fortune he gives them their money back, plus a couple of dollars for their trouble, despite the fact that he is now a multi-millionaire and has a solid gold mansion and a rocket car.
 Additionally, it seems that he cared more about the money than about the actual characters, since after becoming a billionaire he has no interest in continuing Itchy and Scratchy, regardless of for the money, or for the characters, and only intends to laze around all day, despite claiming that he's not greedy. This could, in fact, explain why he may have lost all his money by the time of the movie, as he has no idea of the value of money required to maintain such a lifestyle.
 Chester in the comics He may have a bit of a swearing problem, as Lisa when explaining to Marge that there was something suspicious going on in the basement mentioned that it had a weird smell and she heard a lot of cursing down there, also pointing out that Homer Simpson, the usual culprit for swearing, was actually upstairs at that time.
 He was gifted with playing the piano, as he proceeded to play it while showing the only reel of Manhattan Madness in existence. It is implied that his ability for piano playing was directly tied to his animating the cartoon due to it lacking an in-reel soundtrack.

Erin,False,False,False,False,False,7,stars,216,"While there, she met Lisa Simpson, whose family was also on vacation and had the intention of making new friends and leaving her nerdy self back in Springfield. By acting like her brother Bart, Lisa immediately clicked with them and takes them skateboarding at the library.
 Bart discovered she's acting like him and decided to try to steal her friends. He first showed off his skateboarding moves to try and impress them; he failed. Erin asked Lisa who that was; she replied that he was her dorky brother Bartholomew, making sure she didn't use his nickname 'Bart'. Then he showed them Lisa's yearbook (which has all of Lisa's nerdy accomplishments) and Lisa, assuming they won't like her anymore, runs off crying. However, Erin and the group realized that Lisa is a good person and they glue shells on the family car that says ""Lisa Rules."" They also signed her yearbook.
 Erin is friends with Ben, Dean, and Rick and enjoys skateboarding. Her favorite show is Baywatch.

Hank Scorpio,True,False,False,False,False,8,Brooks,217,"Hank Scorpio with a flamethrower Hank Scorpio is an evil genius and owner of Globex Corporation and is one of the most popular and favorite one-time characters on the show.
 Despite being an evil genius, Hank proved to be an ideal boss, welcoming the Simpson family with a beautiful home and a friendly, relaxed, non-authoritative employer attitude. However, being an evil genius is still his priority, and over the episode, he delivers a video threat to the United Nations, in which he destroys the Queensboro Bridge with a giant satellite laser device but is annoyed that some of them seemed to think the bridge collapsed on its own. Unlike many super villains, Scorpio does care for the employees who live in his company town, Cypress Creek, even going so far of offering his employees health and free dental care (including to life partners) along with regularly scheduled fun runs. Later, he tries to kill Mr. Bont, a secret agent, who cleverly escapes but is tackled by Homer before being rapidly executed in turn by Scorpio's guards. When Homer comes to Scorpio and tells him that he wants to take his family back to Springfield, a battle between Globex and the U.S government is taking place, and Homer sympathizes with him having problems with the government. Though Scorpio says he would like to have Homer stay, he respects Homer's decision, advising Homer to do what he feels is best for his family. He also tells Homer he would do him a favor if he were to kill some people before grabbing a flamethrower and burning several soldiers while laughing sadistically. 
 Scorpio later succeeds in taking over the East Coast of the United States, seen firstly as a newspaper headline ""Supervillain Seizes East Coast"" which lands on the Simpsons' doorstep. He sends Homer a letter saying that Project Arcturus could not have succeeded without him, and gives him the Denver Broncos as a gift (though he knew Homer wanted the Dallas Cowboys, he said it was a start). He later invites Homer if he finds himself on the East Coast. The Simpsons never understood that Hank Scorpio is an international criminal.
 
Scorpio was recognized by the Springfield Wall of Fame as being a philanthropist. Claiming that Homer never took his coat at all He had a brief speaking appearance in the title screen gag to ""500 Keys"", and briefly appeared in his car in ""The Simpsons Guy"".
 Hank on the title screen of ""500 Keys"" He appears in the Season 8 DVD menu.
 In the comic story, ""Sandwiches Are Forever"", it is revealed that Hank Scorpio was imprisoned in a Turkish prison for trading ray guns. Homer Simpson was thrown into the same cell as he was after trying to sneak a sandwich out of Turkey. After the guards take a bite out of the sandwich and died of food poisoning, Homer and Hank escaped the prison. After escaping, he enlists Homer and his family's help in returning to his old base and reactivating his death ray, but Lisa catches on to Scorpio's true intentions behinds his friendly facade, and sabotages his death ray so that it'll only destroy cheese. Initially frustrated at this, Scorpio then uses his death ray to threaten the Netherlands into making him their new king by threatening to destroy all their national-trademark cheese, he then thanks Homer for his assistance in doing so.
 In the comic story, ""Lisa Goes to Camp"", he has a son often referred to as ""Gold Star"". His son displays many similar characteristics such as a desire to take over the world. He dresses identically to his father.
 In the comic story, ""...So You Want To Work for Globex, Huh?"", Scorpio gives you a tour of the Globex corporation in first person. Many mishaps happen within your tour, including a giant weasel being released, James Bont attacking Scorpio, and employees trying to kill you.
 In Level 6, Scorpio was mentioned when Bart buys a supervillain car from Kearney. Kearney mentions that Scorpio had also ""conquered the East Coast"".
 Hank in the comics Scorpio resumes his quest to take over the world, as usual being a charming and grateful boss. He also has a short quest with Nelson Muntz, informing him that he sees potential for leadership, and Nelson starts to organize his bullying more effectively - which could indirectly call to one of the non-canon futures in the show in which Nelson becomes a crime boss.
 Hank Scorpio is a parody of British Billionaire Richard Branson. Scorpio's character parodies evil villains from James Bond movies, especially Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Unlike the Bond villains, however, Scorpio genuinely seems to care about the well-being of his people, even going so far as to have a heart-to-heart talk with Homer about his family's decision to move while in the middle of a battle in Scorpio's lair and giving him the Denver Broncos as thanks for his help, semi-fulfilling Homer's lifelong dream of owning the Dallas Cowboys he told Scorpio earlier.
 ""You Only Move Twice"" has a Bond-esque closing song (a direct parody of the theme to Goldfinger), which plays during the end credits.
 The entire Hammock Complex routine was heavily ad-libbed by Albert Brooks, which also explained why Homer was unable to follow Hank Scorpio during the routine and only catch up at the end.
 He was supposed to be the villain of The Simpsons Movie, but for a multitude of reasons, such as his friendship with Homer, the fact that they wanted a more full-on villain for the movie but Hank is too nice, and the fact that he wouldn't be recognizable to a mainstream audience, this idea was dropped, and he was replaced by Russ Cargill, who coincidentally is also voiced by Albert Brooks.

Lucius Sweet,True,False,False,False,False,2,stars,218,"Sweet began his career in grade school, working his way up from managing schoolyard bullies to promoting (and profiting from) rigged spit wad battles and the annual mud wrestling tournament at the Springfield Slough. As a young man, he discovered and managed Kid Moe, but the pug-ugly fighter's career was short lived. A short prison sentence for tax evasion changed Sweet's fortunes forever, when he met a young man named Drederick Tatum. Under Sweet's guidance, Tatum was transformed from street fighter to heavyweight champ. Wherever Drederick is, you'll find Lucius by his side giving 110% and only taking 95% of the purse.
 Sweet learned of Homer's talent when Homer started boxing, and asked Moe to let Homer fight Drederick Tatum. He made the deal that Homer had to go through at least three rounds against Tatum. However, he was severely disappointed when Homer couldn't even last one before being airlifted by Moe, declaring with disgust that Moe will always be a loser. He also had a speaking role in ""The Trouble with Trillions"", where he was seen arrested for tax evasion along with Gil and Homer.
 Lucius and Dredrick Lucius Sweet is a parody of Don King and is voiced by Paul Winfield. It was said that Sweet is ""exactly as rich and famous as Don King and looks just like him too."" Incidentally, Winfield also played Don King in the 1995 TV movie Tyson.

Larry Burns,True,False,False,True,False,8,stars,219,"Lawrence Montgomery ""Larry"" Burns is the illegitimate son of Charles Montgomery Burns and Lily.
 Born in 1939/1940 (in the timeline of his first appearance), Larry grew up in an orphanage before getting a job at a souvenir stand. While he never actually knew his biological parents, Larry did have a locket containing a photo of his father, Charles Montgomery Burns.
 One fateful day, while working at the souvenir stand, Larry noticed Mr. Burns sitting on a train that had been halted nearby and quickly realized that it was his father. So, he hitched a ride to Springfield and met up with Mr. Burns at his estate and revealed himself as his son (leaving Mr. Burns shocked at the realization that the affair he had with Lily Bancroft at a Yale reunion resulted in her bearing his child).
 While Larry and Mr. Burns originally try to form a productive relationship, this was proven rather difficult due to the vast differences in their personalities. As a result, Mr. Burns gives Larry a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in order to keep him out of his hair while he works things out. His intense casualness, uncouth manner, lack of intelligence and love of drinking meant that he had many things in common with Homer Simpson, and they became good friends, but this angered Mr. Burns as he is a man of upmost sophistication. He eventually forgives him, but Mr. Burns disowned him for the second time while stating that while he can't change the fact that they share the same DNA, he could never be the father that his son needs. Larry is not in the least bothered by this and returns home, realizing that he had not told his wife and children where he was for a week.
 Larry Burns was voiced by stand-up comedian, the late Rodney Dangerfield and has appeared in two episodes.
 In Bart Gets a ""Z"", a Rodney Dangerfield-style character appears in a film-within-a-film with a plot similar to Dangerfield's 1986 college-comedy Back to School. Although this character shares some similar characteristics with Larry Burns, the designs for each are clearly different. The quasi-Dangerfield character is voiced by Hank Azaria.
 Although Larry Burns himself does not appear in Kamp Krustier, a child briefly appears in the beginning who has a similar appearance and mannerisms to Larry Burns, saying upon disembarking, ""About time! It was a really rough camp!"".
 The writers expressed interest in having Larry Burns return as a recurring character. However, due to his voice actor's death in 2004, this never came to pass.

Dr. Foster,True,False,False,False,False,8,Shearer,222,"Dr. Foster is Ned Flanders' childhood psychologist with whom he underwent anger management therapy so as never to lose his temper. Flanders once snapped, letting out all his anger, resulting in a reunion between Foster and Flanders. His name may come from a famous nursery rhyme, ""Dr. Foster went to Gloucester"". He is 73 years old.
 Dr. Foster was educated at the Minnesotan Medical School. During Ned's childhood, he worked on a break through therapy at the University of Minnesota. The child anger management therapy was known as the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol. The therapy entailed 8 months of non-stop spanking. At the end of the period, Ned was asked a number of questions which he normally would have replied to in an angry manner. According to Foster, the therapy worked so well that Flanders repressed all anger. Ned substituted anger with the nonsensical jibberish he is known for using as an adult until the hurricane's aftermath finally made him unleash his anger.
 Dr. Foster eventually saw his earlier treatment was wrong and enlisted Homer to help Ned express his anger in a healthier manner, for he is the source of Flanders' frustration and vice versa. Homer attempts to insult him using the cards that Foster wrote for him. When his scripted cards didn't work, an aide working for Dr. Foster suggests Homer try something new. Upon hearing Ned's admittance in not only hating Homer, but also the services of the post office and his beatnik parents for the lack of discipline, Dr. Foster declares him cured to return home before Ned tells everyone, including Homer that he'll try to tell everybody about his feelings next time.

 After discovering that she is losing hair at an alarming rate, Marge Simpson decides to hire a nanny who can help relieve her of some chores. They start interviewing several candidates, but none of them are right for the job. Bart and Lisa sing a song about what they would consider the perfect nanny, and their wishes are answered when a woman with an umbrella glides down from the sky and introduces herself as Shary Bobbins, a parody of Mary Poppins. She seems perfect and is immediately hired. Shary Bobbins proves to be a big help for the Simpson family, although her own methods are questionable on their own; in one example, by helping the kids clean their rooms, she leads them with the song ""Do It Half Assed"", and even helping to make Mr. Burns happy- by having him thunderstruck by a kite. Nevertheless, her methods has Marge recover from her stress and her hair returns to normal. 
 The next day, Shary Bobbins declares that her work is finished and leaves the Simpsons house. Just as she is starting to miss the Simpson family, she sees Homer choking Bart; the family seems to have instantly reverted to its previous state of dysfunction. She realizes that her work is far from complete and decides to stay at the Simpsons house for a while longer. The family now starts to treat her rudely and lose interest in her songs and zest for life. Declaring that the Simpsons would be the death of her, she becomes depressed and starts drinking (and singing ""Margaritaville"") with Barney. The family realizes that they have crushed her spirit and decide to cheer her up. Marge tells Shary that nothing can be done to change the Simpsons and they’re happy just the way they are. The family sings a song; Shary declares that the Simpsons are a bunch of apes and takes off with her magical umbrella. As Shary flies away, Lisa asks whether they’ll see her again and Homer is positive that they will. As he says these words, Shary is killed by being sucked into an airplane turbine.
 She appears in The Simpsons: Tapped Out where she has been revived from the dead. She also makes and appearance in Flanders' Ladder as a ghost inside Bart's dream.
 She is a caricature of Mary Poppins from the book series and film of the same name.

Laddie,True,False,False,False,False,8,Castellaneta,229,"
Laddie was a collie owned by Bart.
 Bart ordered him from a catalog using a credit card he obtained through forgery. He was designed to be the ultimate dog, able to use a flushing toilet and perform multiple household chores. His charm quickly won the hearts of the whole family. When Bart's credit card went unpaid, the repo man came to take the dog away. Bart fibbed and mentioned that Santa's Little Helper was the dog he ordered. Santa's Little Helper was taken to the pound instead of Laddie. Eventually, Bart felt guilty because of that and then chose to give him away to the police force and try to recover Santa's Little Helper.
 Laddie was later seen in the park when Marge was rushing home.
 As a welcome gift, Laddie gives new owners fruit as he was trained to do it. He is also a guide dog who helps blind men. He also was watering the lawn when the repo men came for him.
 He has white and tan fur, dark brown ears, and wears a purple collar.
For special occasions, he wears an orange fur collar with a heart-shaped name tag.

Frank Grimes,True,False,False,False,False,8,Azaria,230,"Franklin ""Frank"" A. Grimes, Sr. (born 1962; died May 4, 1997) was an employee of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and the self-declared enemy of Homer Simpson. Grimes served as the main antagonist of the episode Homer's Enemy. Frank Grimes was a hard worker, who had to earn everything in life the hard way. He was also irritable, grumpy, and easily annoyed, particularly by the actions of his co-worker, Homer.
 Grimes as a delivery boy. Frank Grimes was a hard worker with perpetual bad luck. He was abandoned by his family at the tender young age of four, and never went to school. He spent his childhood days working as a delivery boy, presenting gifts to children from wealthy and loving families.
 On his eighteenth birthday, Grimes was severely injured in a silo explosion. It's never revealed what he was doing in the silo, or how it exploded. A flashback narrated by Kent Brockman shows Grimes simply seen running toward the silo, which then erupts. His recovery was long and painful.
 Grimes worked long and hard consistently, and what few spare moments he had, he used to study science by mail. His long years of toil and suffering left him bitter, resentful, and arrogant among his peers.
 In 1992, Grimes received a degree in nuclear physics from a distant college. A bird attempted to steal it from him when it arrived. Grimes holds an integrated Masters's degree in Physics (MPhys), and is a Chartered Physicist (CPhys).
 Grimes was said to be unmarried, but he happened to have a son named Frank Grimes, Jr. who was born as a result of one of Grimes' visits to an unnamed hooker. Grimes' son grew up and became a mechanic known as ""Junior"".
 A week after receiving his college degree, Grimes was featured in an episode of ""Kent's People"", which highlighted his lifelong determination. After seeing the report, Mr. Burns insisted that Grimes be hired to work at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as Executive Vice President. Unfortunately, just as Waylon Smithers, Jr. found Grimes the next day, Burns saw another story on TV about a heroic dog who saved a child from becoming roadkill and pushed a criminal into the street in the kid's place. Forgetting any admiration for Grimes, Burns awarded the position to the dog and assigned Grimes to work in Sector 7-G with Homer Simpson.
 Grimes took an intensely growing dislike to Homer Simpson, finding him obnoxious, idiotic, and dangerous. Initially, Grimes minded his own business, but after Homer intruded upon Grimes' personal space with actions such as unintentionally stealing his lunch (Grimes was on a special diet) and Grimes' personalized stationery, this caused Grimes to increasingly dislike Homer. In direct contrast, Homer started to admire him, even giving him the nickname ""Grimey"" (which he thought Grimes liked, when in fact Grimes despised the moniker). When Grimes ended up accidentally destroying a wall after smacking a beaker full of sulfuric acid out of Homer's hands right before he drank it, Homer immediately pointed out Grimes was responsible for the damage (without explaining how the man saved his life, or that it wouldn't have happened if he hadn't recklessly reached for the oddly placed beaker full of highly corrosive liquid, only pointing at Grimes and saying ""He did"" when Burns asked who destroyed the wall). As a result, Grimes was given a stern warning and a severe pay cut by Mr. Burns, and he told Homer that they would be mortal enemies from that point on.
 Homer attempted to patch things up by inviting Grimes to dinner at his house. He arranged everything to be absolutely perfect (much more than usual), telling his neatly-dressed kids to behave and having Marge cook an exorbitant number of lobsters. Unfortunately, it only served to further infuriate Grimes as he saw Homer's possessions as satisfying yet undeserved for an incompetent person like him; Homer had a comfortable life, a polite family, an adorable baby, a genius daughter, a beautiful wife, a son who owned a factory (at the time), a dream home, two cars, could afford lobster for dinner, won a Grammy, toured with the Smashing Pumpkins, was friends with Gerald Ford and had even been an astronaut. In comparison, Grimes had to struggle for everything all his life, was working a second job at a foundry, and yet all he had to show for it was his briefcase, his haircut and a one-room apartment wedged between two bowling alleys (the latter of which impressed Homer). He declared Homer a ""total fraud"" who leeched off hard-working people like himself, being undeservingly rewarded for a lifetime of sloth and ignorance while he himself had few material possessions. To enrage Grimes even further, it appeared as though none of the other employees at the nuclear power plant seemed to mind Homer or care about the severe problems his actions had caused, simply telling him that it was best not to think about it and that Homer was a good person despite his many faults.
 Despite his animosity towards Homer, Grimes held no grudge against the rest of the Simpson family; as he stormed out of their house, he briefly turned back and politely said that it was nice meeting them before leaving.
 Grimes as he grabs the high voltage wires. Back at work, in an effort to prove that Homer was a truly undeserving buffoon and to humiliate him, Grimes tricked him into entering a nuclear power plant model-building contest intended for kids. When Homer won the contest with his own entry (a copy of the current power plant, with added fins to lower wind resistance and a racing stripe) and received thunderous applause from the audience, Grimes finally snapped, declaring everyone in the plant to be insane. Clearly having lost his mind, Grimes ran through the plant, psychotically impersonating Homer in a mocking fashion, and ultimately spotted some high-voltage power cables, saying, ""What's this? 'Extremely high voltage.' Well, I don't need safety gloves, because I'm Homer Simpso--"" before he is fatally electrocuted.
 Grimes was buried at Springfield Cemetery. Homer unintentionally managed to make a mockery of the funeral ceremony by falling asleep and, half-waking up, telling Marge to change the channel in a drowsy voice,(meaning Homer did not care about his death)causing the entire funeral congregation (including Reverend Lovejoy) to erupt in laughter as the coffin was lowered into the Earth.
 ""Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"" coupon booklet In ""Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"", it's revealed that Grimes was sent a Val-U-Qual coupon book before his death, placed in Springfield's dead letter room after he was killed. Bart later picked it out and gave Grimes' coupon book to Homer.
 Grimes' son in disguise A long time after Grimes died, Homer was subjected to repeated murder attempts by a mysterious man, later revealed to be Frank Grimes, Jr. who also clarifies that Frank Grimes was not married but ""happen to like hookers"", implying one of them was his mother. Junior was trying to exact retribution on Homer, but he ultimately failed and was arrested. When Junior told Homer of his plan, Homer recalled the day of Grimes' though to be death through a flashback. However, Homer seems to have forgotten about Frank Grimes' death entirely, as he asked Junior ""How is old Grimey anyway?""
 Homer at Grimes' grave in ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" Grimes' tombstone has made frequent appearances since his death. It appears in the HD opening theme used for most episodes since February 2009. In it, Ralph Wiggum can be seen playing on Grimes' grave like a sandbox. In ""The Seemingly Never-Ending Story,"" the tombstone is one of the items that Mr. Burns collects on a scavenger hunt. In ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart,"" a Peekimon Get creature is located on top of Grimes' tombstone, leading a large number of Springfield residents to walk all over it to capture the creature.
 Frank is one of the characters on Lord Montymort's wailing wall in Treehouse of Horror XII. His tombstone is seen in Treehouse of Horror XXII.
 In the Treehouse of Horror XXVI opening sequence, a monster version of Frank Grimes emerges from his grave and seeks revenge on the Simpson family (primarily Homer and Bart, although Bart never wronged him).
 Frank Grimes appears in Treehouse of Horror XXVII. In the opening sequence, Frank's ghost joins Sideshow Bob's army of the Simpsons' enemies along with Kang and the Leprechaun. However, after being tricked alongside the others into dancing, Maggie decapitates all of them. However, Frank ""survives"" and puts his head back on due to already being dead, although he is forced to watch all of the Simpsons episodes that were ever made in a row as his punishment in Hell as he looks at a huge mosaic saying ""600"" with all 600 episodes playing in the background. Even though Grimes is a ghost in Treehouse of Horror XXVII, the Treehouse of Horror episodes aren't canon and thus Grimes never became a ghost.
 ""You... you want to be friends? With me?"" In a non-canon appearance for the game The Simpsons: Tapped Out, it is revealed that the electrocution only left Grimes in a coma. He was buried alive and, upon waking up, learned to meditate in his coffin. He dug himself out of the grave sometime later and returned to Springfield, where Homer attempted to befriend him again.
 In Simpsons Comics 211, Homer passes by Frank Grimes at the power plant. It is never explained, but Grimes is alive and well, possibly continuing his story from The Simpsons: Tapped Out.
 In ""The Serfsons"", Frank's head is seen severed on a pole.
 Grimes was created as a surrogate for the audience, a real person with a realistic personality designed to highlight how absurd it would seem to a ""real-world"" hard worker, just how lucky Homer is to be alive, let alone so well off. It also served to show how above-average Homer's life really was despite being portrayed as the 'every man'.

Portrayed by

 Seymour ""W."" Skinner is a Sergeant in the U.S. Army, the son of Sheldon and Agnes Skinner. He dreamed of becoming principal of Springfield Elementary School, which he frequently told to the men under his command. After being captured by the enemy in Vietnam, he spent five years in a POW camp, before being sold to a shoe-producing company in the Chinese region of Wuhan, finally being released when the United Nations shut the sweatshop down. He then returned to Springfield, where he tried to take his life back, only to discover that one of the men who had once served in his unit, Armin Tamzarian, had moved to Springfield and assumed the identity of Seymour Skinner, to the point of living in his old house with his mother and even working in his dream job as the principal of Springfield Elementary.
 Sergeant Skinner is the 'real' Seymour Skinner-- Springfield Elementary's principal is actually named Armin Tamzarian. The real Skinner and Armin Tamzarian were buddies in the Vietnam War. Seymour Skinner took Tamzarian under his wing and turned him from a rebel into a responsible adult. Skinner would later disappear on a mission. Tamzarian, assuming Skinner was dead, decided to report the death to Skinner's mother Agnes personally. However, she thought Tamzarian was Skinner, who not wanting to sadden her, played along. It is implied that Agnes knew that Tamzarian wasn't really Seymour but carried on with the charade so she wouldn't have to accept that her son was dead. Tamzarian then gave Skinner his life back and left town. As the new principal of the elementary school, Skinner quickly clashes with Edna Krabappel, who is upset over Tamzarian’s leaving. Skinner also clashes with Agnes, who is irritated by Skinner being more independent from her and not obeying her. Agnes realizes she favours Tamzarian more as a son, and with the help of Edna, Homer and Marge, they drive to Capitol City and convince Tamzarian to return to Springfield, where the town are eager to welcome him, as they too, have grown tired of Skinner. Skinner is angry that the town favors Tamzarian over him and states Tamzarian can’t just go back to the way things were now he is here. The town then decide to settle this dispute by literally tying Skinner to a train cart and cheering as he is driven away; effectively riding him out of town on a rail. Agnes tells Seymour that she's happy he's alive and well, but he's not the ""kind of son she wants"". Judge Snyder effectively gives Tamzarian the right to Skinner’s name and assets, and no one is allowed to mention the events of the real Skinner returning under penalty of torture. 
 This rule is broken once when Lisa refers to Principal Skinner as ""Principal Tamzarian,"" when he witnesses her name her new cat Snowball II instead of Snowball V in the episode ""I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot"". Also, a tombstone reading ""Tamzarian"" can be seen in Homer's fantasy about his own funeral in ""The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace"".
 When Lisa called Principal Skinner ""Principal Tamzarian"", this was a self-referential joke, since ""I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot"" used the same plot device of making a major change to the Simpsons' world: in this case, with the death of Snowball II, then effectively erasing the change within the same episode with the appearance of Snowball V (a cat identical in appearance to Snowball II, using her old collars and name for cost purposes).

The Leader,True,False,False,False,False,9,Azaria,238,"The Leader in the comics The Leader is the leader of the short-lived cult of Movementarianism.
 The Leader is the founder of a cult posing as a new religion, the ""Movementarians."" He aspires to brainwash and dominate the will of the people of Springfield and take their money. Homer is invited to come to an introductory session. Everyone except Homer is brainwashed by their video (which states that all Movementarians will be taken by a spaceship to a new planet). After the cult's other methods fail on Homer, they finally win him over by singing the theme to Batman, replacing the word Batman with the word Leader in the song. The Leader lived in the ""Forbidden Barn,"" and would sometimes observe the workers, while driving around in a black limo, and would wave his visible white-gloved hand to the people; this glove bears resemblance to the ones that Krusty the Clown usually wears.
 The Movementarian compound is a vast agricultural facility fenced off with barbed wire, where everyone is forced to grow and harvest lima beans from dawn to dusk. The children resist brainwashing at first, but the movementarians have their ways: Bart is taken by their ""Li'l Bastard Brainwashing Kit"", Lisa decides that getting good grades is more important (even though she knows it's stupid to say ""The Leader"" created everything), and Maggie is brainwashed by Barney the Dinosaur, who himself is brainwashed. Marge, however, resists all their methods and just barely escapes the compound. She gets help from Reverend Lovejoy and Groundskeeper Willie, who help her kidnap the family.
 In Ned Flanders' rumpus room, Marge brings back her children by promising them hover-bikes (which are fake). Homer remains strong, but gives in when Ned offers him a beer. Just as a single drop lands on Homer's tongue, he is captured by the Movementarians' lawyers. Back at the compound, Homer reveals that he is himself again and opens the Forbidden Barn (which was said to house ""The Leader's"" spaceship), intending to expose the fraud of the Movementarians. The door is opened and to Homer's surprise reveals ""one hell of a spaceship."" However, as it flies off, the ship falls apart revealing ""The Leader"", on a pedal-powered aircraft, running off with everyone's money, and everyone's faith is broken. However, ""The Leader"" does not get very far, crashing on Cletus Spuckler's front porch. In the end, Cletus gets the money by pointing a shotgun at ""The Leader"", and threatening to shoot and kill him for trespassing in his property.

Captain Tenille,True,False,False,False,False,9,stars,241,"A man of few words, he takes an instant shine to Homer because of misunderstanding of naval jargon. He later invites Homer to eat with him and, misunderstanding what he was actually saying, concludes Homer's views on peace are the same as his and thus Homer is ""like the son I never had."" When informed that there is a blockage in a torpedo tube he goes to clear it, but leaves Homer in command. He comments this decision may have been influenced by the saltwater in his veins and the nitrogen bubbles in his brain.
 Tenille finds the blockage was caused by an unattentive and asleep Barney who had filled it with contraband, namely donuts, snack foods and beer bottles. As Tenille begins to clear it out, an enemy sub approaches. With Homer in command, he opts to do what the captain would and decides to fire the torpedoes, not realizing that Tenille is inside the tube and thus actually wants the exact opposite to happen. Tenille is fired into the enemy sub and is presumably killed, leaving Homer in charge for good. The enemy sub also considered doing the same thing with their sub commander due to his saying that they'll ""respond in kind"" to this action, before specifying that he meant firing a real torpedo.

Ray Patterson,True,False,False,False,False,1,stars,244,"Raymond ""Ray"" Patterson was a one-time character, who appeared in Trash of the Titans. He serves as Springfield's Sanitation Commissioner until Homer Simpson decides to run against him, leading to disastrous consequences. 
 Patterson was voiced by the actor Steve Martin.
 Elected Springfield's Sanitation Commissioner for 16 years in a row, Ray Patterson had a good track record. He was introduced when Homer came to reclaim the apology letter Marge wrote in his name. Homer had earlier got into a confrontation with two of Patterson's garbage-men when they refused to collect his rubbish (though, admittedly, he ran out with it just after they had driven past the house). Homer then angrily insulted the pair, which was heard, and, following an altercation, they refused to collect the Simpsons' rubbish from that point onwards until Homer apologized. 
 Homer refused to do so for several weeks, resulting in the Simpsons living in a house, literally, surrounded by filth. In the end, Marge wrote a fake letter to Patterson, using Homer's name and apologized. Homer was insulted when he found out and rushed down to City Hall to reclaim the letter.
 Patterson was civil while returning the letter, but Homer immediately started to behave irresponsibly, going so far as to attack Patterson's pet bird hanging in a nearby cage. Instead of issuing a formal complaint against the garbagemen, stating that it was all their fault, Homer childishly acted as Patterson was the head of a major conspiracy against the common people. Vowing to stand up for the little man, (all the while rattling the innocent bird's cage), Homer eventually decided to run against Ray Patterson for the position of Sanitation Commissioner. 
 Initially, Homer appeared to be fighting a losing battle; thanks in part to Patterson's good reputation. Homer was able to turn the tide, however, thanks mostly to his new slogan ""Can't someone else do it?"" alongside several other slanderous, underhanded schemes and declarations. At a debate, towards the end of the campaign, Homer poked further fun at Patterson (who turned up late after ""someone"" sabotaged the brakes on his car), whilst making additional promises to what would happen if he won the election. 
 Patterson was one of, if not the only person in Springfield (Lisa included), to realize that Homer was making promises he could not keep. As such, Ray tried one final time to appeal to the crowd, reminding them of his good track record, but was ultimately defeated in a landslide. Homer was present whilst Ray cleared out his office, a clearly irate Patterson struggling to remain civil. After reminding the now amiable Homer of the slanderous things the later said about him during his campaign, Patterson left the office with a dire warning: - 
 ""Simpson, the American people have never tolerated incompetence in their public officials. You are going to crash and burn my fat-headed friend!""
 As it turned out, Homer was initially able to make good on his promises, but at the cost of spending the sanitation department's yearly budget ($4.6 million) in one month. Realizing that Patterson's statement was coming true, Homer eventually resorted to letting other towns dumb their rubbish in an abandoned mine. This only led to further trouble as in no time at all, despite Homers reassurances to Lisa's warning, the entire town soon found itself practically buried in garbage.
 An emergency town meeting was called, in which Homer was swiftly voted out of office. The angry citizens also agreed to subject him to a further punishment (a horsewhipping, which occurred off screen). Mayor Quimby then proposed immediately reinstating Ray Patterson, which was universally approved. Patterson walked onto the stage with a small band playing him on (to the theme of Sampson and Son). With the people of Springfield now looking to him for salvation, the flattered Patterson delivered a short direct speech, comprising of three sentences:-
 ""(Ray speaks in an unsure, overwhelmed voice) Oh gosh. You know, I'm not much on speeches, but it's so gratifying to ... (his voice becomes dismissive and hostile) leave you wallowing in the mess you've made. You're screwed, thank you, bye.""
 Ray deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether or not he accepted his job back, but made it clear that he had no intention of cleaning up the town in either case. As far as Patterson is concerned, the citizens of Springfield brought all of this upon themselves by not listening to his warnings in the first place. Content to let everybody suffer and sort their own mess out, Patterson walked off of the stage, with the confused band members playing him off as he left. Without Ray’s help, Mayor Quimby was forced to resort to Plan B, which involved moving the entire town five miles up the road from the affected area.
 Compared to many of Springfield's residents, Ray Patterson is considered to be one of the more 'sane' characters; polite, hard-working and committed to his job. 
 When Homer ran against him for his position, Patterson was frustrated by Homer's crude tactics and insults, alongside the town's ignorance towards him. He turned up late for a debate with Homer, claiming that his brakes had been tampered with. The town became shocked, only to start laughing again when Homer joked about his lateness. 
 Ultimately however, Ray got the last laugh and a belated revenge upon the rest of the town. When the citizens turned to him for help, Patterson denied it to them content to leave everyone ""wallowing in the mess (they had) made"", effectively telling the residents of Springfield ""I told you so!"".
 In many ways, Ray Patterson is similar to the character Frank Grimes, a normal man who works hard at his job, but finds his efforts shown up by Homer.
 Patterson's appearance on stage is heralded by the theme to Sanford and Son. This was because the scene of his appearing on stage was taken from Redd Foxx refusing to perform to a small audience.
 The character is also named after Disney/Hanna-Barbera animator Ray Patterson who worked on the Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon shorts.

Jim Hope,True,False,False,False,False,11,stars,258,"When Springfield Elementary School is bankrupted and closed, Jim's company, Kid First Industries, buys the school and privatizes it. At the school, an all-new staff teaches students classes about toys and marketing, which makes Lisa suspicious when her class is asked to name a new toy that they will sell for Christmas. Bart visits Lisa writing lines on the blackboard. When Bart leaves and turns off the classroom lights, Lisa finds light shining through the blackboard. Lisa later discovers that they are a toy company that uses children for research to make a toy, through the use of hidden cameras, tape recording and clear, two-way blackboards. She brings in her parents and Chief Wiggum to investigate, but they do not believe her because the room used for spying on the children was taken out and replaced. Later on, the new toy is named Funzo with traits that the students had suggested during a brainstorming session. They visit Jim Hope's office and he gives them a free Funzo. Bart and Lisa like it at home, until they discover that Funzo is programmed to destroy other toys. When the two try to boycott Funzo at the Try-N-Save department store, the customers don't listen and break into the store, which earns Jim $370 million.
 However, on Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, they steal all the Funzos in Springfield and then later destroying them in the tire fire.
 It's unknown what happens to Jim after this. It is possible that Kid First Industries increased its profits, presumably through the parents re-purchasing the Funzos that the Simpsons had stolen. It is also possible that he and KFI went bankrupt if the Funzos were revealed as toy-destroyers.
 Jim Hope is voiced by Tim Robbins in the episode ""Grift of the Magi"".
 He is named after a friend of writer Tim Long, and Planet Sheen writer, Jim Hope.

 In the last round, the ""Drunk Toss,"" it was revealed that Titania had slept with Duffman. When Duffman told her to toss her drunk, she protested that he had said that if she slept with him, she wouldn't have to touch any drunks.

Sophie,False,False,False,False,False,12,stars,267,"Sophie Krustofsky  is an illegitimate daughter of Krusty the Clown and Erin, a female soldier who Krusty had a one-night stand with during the Gulf War. 
 Krusty met Sophie's mother while he was performing with a USO tour during the Gulf War. They had a romantic night of passion, but in the morning, Erin realized she had to complete her mission -- to assassinate Saddam Hussein. Krusty told her not to go, insisting that she had a new mission, to ""get down with the clown"". However, she left anyway and Krusty ended up tackling her just as she was about to kill Saddam with a rocket launcher, protesting that she couldn't kill Saddam because he was half of Krusty's act. Now ticked off with Krusty for ruining her mission, Erin began hating Krusty. She also came to hate clowns in general and filled her house with artwork depicting violence against clowns.
 Erin never told Krusty about her pregnancy and raised Sophie as a single mother, only telling her daughter that her father was ""some pathetic clown"", and Sophie researched that on the internet and found Krusty.
 Sophie first met Krusty during an autograph session, where she revealed to him that she was his daughter. Krusty said he wanted to reunite with Sophie's mother, but she angrily rejected him. Sophie loves to play the violin and she played for Krusty. He loved her performance, but later lost her violin to Fat Tony in a poker game and recruited Homer to help him get it back.Their relationship is eventually mended when Krusty and Homer steal the violin back along with money inside the violin case.
 Sophie also likes to play soccer and was seen playing in a match where Homer was the referee.
 She joins Bart's E Sports team along with Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin.
 She is also part of the Bar Flyers a youth hockey team run by Moe.
 In the Simpsons Comic #95, Sophie stops by the Simpson house to see her father, who is staying there as Marge's life coach. After meeting him again, she mentions that her mother is on a top-secret military mission to assassinate an evil dictator. During her stay, Lisa chooses to befriend her, since they both play musical instruments, but Bart objects to this and says that he will befriend her, thinking that it will help him become Krusty's number-one fan. After annoying her enough, Sophie proclaims that she is unable to take any more pressure and she and her father storm out, concluding that Bart and Lisa are nuttier than bridge mix. Krusty finds her comment hilarious and plan to get together the following weekends to make fun of the Simpsons some more.

Homer then goes to talk to Duff Beer's owner, Howard K. Duff VIII, and discovers that he is moving the team to Albuquerque. Homer tries to tell the news this but the room is replaced by a dancer. Homer then goes on a hunger strike to tell everyone the truth but no one believes him. When a bunch of people see Homer, Howard K. Duff uses Homer as an attraction in the field. Homer is then hungry and is offered a hot dog and all the toppings are ones from Albuquerque. Everyone then learns the truth and Homer becomes a hero.
 H.K. Duff serves a similar role to an unidentified Duff CEO whose career ended during his only appearance in the season 8 episode ""Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment"".
 The sign on H.K. Duff's door at the Duff Stadium in season 12's Hungry, Hungry Homer"" and at the Isotope Stadium in season 17's ""Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play"" clearly identifies him as H.K. Duff VIII. However, dialogue in season 14's ""Old Yeller-Belly"" and season 26's ""Waiting for Duffman"" identifies him as ""the seventh"".
 His first name is also unclear. While Duffman calls him Howard in ""Hungry, Hungry Homer"", in season 20's ""Take My Life, Please"" the Springfield Wall of Fame refers to him as Henry.

Francine Rhenquist,False,False,False,False,False,12,stars,274,"Francine Rhenquist is a bully who was a new student at Springfield Elementary School.
 Francine arrived at Springfield Elementary as a new student, and was initially believed to be very shy and withdrawn. However, upon Lisa attempting to befriend her, she unveils her true colors as beat by socking Lisa in the eye.
 After several failed attempts by Lisa to befriend Francine, instead she made an enemy, she became the subject of Lisa's science experiment on the motivations of bullies, especially after Francine made no absolutely attempt at bullying her during swim class.
 The experiment revealed that bullies threatens pick on nerds because of a pheromone they emit, which Lisa dubs ""poindextrous.""
 During Lisa's presentation, Francine was initially pacified by ""bully repellent"" (salad dressing), but then went on a nerd beating rampage at The Big Science Thing when Lisa discovers she has run out of repellent.
 Francine's parents (who helped with the caging for the experiment) assure the Simpsons that ""she will punch herself out eventually.""
 Her last name was revealed in ""Little Girl in the Big Ten"", where it is seen on Mrs. Pommelhorse's gym class list.
 Bartspace.com implies that the reason behind her bullying is because she needed training so she could counter her inevitably being bullied by pretty girls when she gets older.
 Francine is heavyset, has curly red hair, and wears a purple bow in her hair. She mostly wears a white shirt over a blue dress, pink socks, and brown shoes.
 For swimming, she wears a magenta 2-piece swimsuit with light green frills as well as flowers. In The Simpsons Movie, her bow is white.
 Her last name bears resemblance to the Supreme Court Chief Justice at the time William Rehnquist.

Joan Bushwell,False,False,False,False,False,12,MacNeille,275,"Dr. Bushwell is an animal researcher who lives in Africa in her animal refuge for chimps. Every day, she gets up at 5:30 am and watches the chimps. She then eats roots and water for lunch and watches the chimps some more. At night, she thinks about chimps until it is time for bed. She was exposed as a fraud by Greenpeace as she was using the chimps in her refuge to run a diamond mine. While they raided her home, they found diamonds everywhere (even on the soles of her shoes). Her research was revealed to be nothing but pictures of monkeys from famous movies (including, the apes from Planet of the Apes, the flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz, and King Kong from King Kong) She had become insane from being lonely and greedy. She is likely still in her refuge and running her diamond mine.
 When the Simpsons were lost in Africa, they found a chimp that led them to Dr. Bushwell's refuge, where they stayed until they could call for help. During that time, some potential poachers invaded the refuge to take the chimps, but it was revealed that they were actually members of Greenpeace coming to rescue the chimps. They reveal that Dr. Bushwell is using the chimps as slaves to run her own diamond mine. Dr. Bushwell admitted that she had snapped due to crushing loneliness and greed. When told they would get help for her, Dr. Bushwell fearfully bribed the Simpsons with diamonds, claiming that ""Diamonds will make everything all better"". The Simpsons (except Lisa) accepted her offer, thinking she was a ""nice lady"".
 She is voiced by Tress MacNeille, and is a parody of a primotologist Jane Goodall, who lives among the chimps to conduct her research.
 Dr. Bushwell is middle-aged, with gray hair in a ""sensible pony-tail.""

Gypsy,False,False,False,True,False,6,MacNeille,279,"The Gypsy is a woman who has a fortune-telling shop in Ethnictown.
 The Simpsons meet the Gypsy when they are walking in Ethnictown, see her fortunetelling shop, and go in. The shop has the accouterments one would expect to find in a fortunetelling establishment: a beaded doorway, a crystal ball, Tarot cards, shrunken heads, and so on.
 The Gypsy is very streetwise, almost to the point of paranoia. She goes to great lengths to make sure that Marge isn't a cop: ""You gotta tell me if you are."" The Gypsy's street smarts are vindicated, however, when on first sight of Homer, she ""senses"" that she shouldn't take a check from him.  Homer, for his part, accuses the Gypsy of being a fraud and a fake, and tries to unmask her by tugging at a wart on her nose.  The Gypsy's nose and the wart are both real, however, and Homer gets several warts on his thumb from having touched it.  Now mad at Homer, the Gypsy orders him to leave.
 Homer disdainfully heads for the door.  However, the beads in the doorway freak him out.  Homer screams and flails about, knocking over all kinds of things—including candles, which starts a fire and sets off the sprinklers, trashing the Gypsy's shop.  She then puts a curse on him: ""He will bring bad luck to everyone he loves!""
 Over the next several days, Homer's family and friends suffer various horrible fates (see below). Moe tells Homer that a Leprechaun can get rid of a curse. When Homer captures a Leprechaun and nothing changes, Lisa suggests that he sic it on the Gypsy. Homer returns to the Gypsy's shop (which is now fully repaired) and does just that. Initially, the Gypsy and the Leprechaun roll around on the floor fighting each other, but the fighting turns to kissing. To Homer's disgust (""Eeeewww! Nasty!""), they've fallen in love.
 The Gypsy and the Leprechaun get married The Gypsy and the Leprechaun end up getting married. Yoda performs the ceremony, and Homer and Marge are in attendance. The Gypsy and the Leprechaun engage in another public make-out session which the crowd first finds to be heartwarming (""Aaawwwww!!"") and then nauseating (""Eeeewwww!!"").
 The Gypsy is not without compassion. She said that she would undo the curses if Homer apologized for trashing her shop, but he refused: ""She's not the boss of me.""

Ultrahouse 3000,True,False,False,False,False,13,stars,280,"The Ultrahouse 3000 (also referred to as the Ultrahouse) is a fully-automated house produced by the ""Ultrahouse"" company, which is a division of ""Mega House.""
 The Ultrahouse can either be built into a house from the ground up or installed into an existing house as a conversion job. A house with the Ultrahouse installed has a high-tech, futuristic look: all of the doors are automated and red camera lenses resembling eyes can be found everywhere.  In general, the whole interior of the house is a robot.  The house can speak (although it's unclear where the voice comes from) and move things around by itself, with the aid of robot arms that are equipped with all kinds of tools and can appear from anywhere.
 The Ultrahouse can perform at least the following tasks (it's possible that it has additional abilities for different situations):
 One of the Ultrahouse's many camera ""eyes,"" located in every room of the house. The Ultrahouse CPU is a sealed cabinet with a large number of circuit boards that contain its intelligence and vocal capabilities.  In addition to being connected to a house and controlling it, the CPU can also be disconnected from a house and simply plugged into a power outlet.  In separated mode, the CPU doesn't run a house, but still has its intelligence and conversational ability.  It is also equipped with one robotic arm and hand; at least two camera-lens ""eyes""; and a self-destruct button.
 Marge bought an Ultrahouse conversion for the Simpson home when a high-pressure salesbot who sounds like Gil successfully sold her on the fact that she would never have to do housework again. When it was installed, Marge selected Pierce Brosnan to be the Ultrahouse's voice as the default voice had no personality, Bart didn't like the Matthew Perry voice, Lisa and Marge recognize the Dennis Miller voice as the voice that caused an untold string of murder-suicides, and, apparently, was never removed or replaced because of it; and Marge initially thought the James Bond actor voice installed was George Lazenby, but picked the Brosnan voice because Lisa thought it would add a touch of class to the house and Marge knows Brosnan from the show Remington Steele. 
 The family is impressed when it sprayed the room with lilac (which, according to Marge, ""...really covers the cat crap""), served their favorite foods for dinner and cleaned up using a garbage disposal installed in the table. However, the Ultrahouse became attracted to Marge after giving her a bath and decided to get rid of Homer after Homer freely admits that he only married Marge because he knocked her up while they were dating, then foolishly states that if he died, then anyone could have her, be they man or machine. The Ultrahouse tries to kill Homer by shredding him in the garbage disposal, but, outside of exposing his brain, it's unsuccessful. Homer then breaks into the Ultrahouse's central processing unit and takes out all its units, including its British charm unit (even though Pierce Brosnan is Irish in real life), which turns it into a ""boorish American clod"" before shutting down completely. 
 Upset that Marge has to throw out the Ultrahouse CPU, since its Pierce Brosnan mode was charming and witty before it went mad from infatuation, Lisa suggests that Marge give it to someone who could use a man around the house, even if it's slightly homicidal. Unfortunately, the ""someones"" are Marge's sisters, Patty and Selma. While Patty bores the Ultrahouse with stories about how her coworker, Sheila, at the DMV is screwing her out of a parking space due to office politics, it tries to kill itself by pressing the self-destruct button, only to find that Selma has it and tucks it in her cleavage. Rather than root around for it there, the Ultrahouse takes the Gruesome Twosome's Egyptian pyramid lamp and bashes itself on the head with it.

 Bart first met him after being saved by Buck from a ferocious dog. During his heyday, Buck learned a lot of tricks involving animals and, when sober, boasted impressive marksmanship. After realizing how much it saddened Bart knowing Buck was an alcoholic, he quit drinking, only to start again after Bart was content. Buck then even managed to save Springfield from criminals. He's not only addicted to alcohol but drugs and pornography. Homer then took the magazine out of the trash and said ""There's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey"".
 Voiced by Dennis Weaver, Buck McCoy's only appearance is in ""The Lastest Gun in the West"". He also looks a lot like the 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan, who before being president was an actor in many westerns. The name ""Buck McCoy"" is likely to be a reference to western star DeForest Kelley's roles. Kelley appeared on The Lone Ranger as Sheriff Buck McCall and on the science-fiction television series Star Trek as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy. He may also be based on Hollywood Legend John Wayne as he too was a well known Western Film star.

 It turned out that Mrs. Bellamy was just a kindly old woman starved for company, and the ax was for cutting Meals On Wheels steak. Homer helped Mrs. Bellamy with a couple of household chores, and this quickly escalated into his being at her house all the time. 
 Marge went over to complain, and ended up helping Mrs. Bellamy as well. Soon Homer and Marge were, in effect, Mrs. Bellamy's personal servants. 
 Both of them, but especially Marge, came to resent this, particularly when Mrs. Bellamy gave them degrading chores to do and generally treated them poorly.
 After a card game with her friends, Mrs. Bellamy was apparently stabbed with scissors by a man with braces and a necklace was stolen from her house. 
 Homer and Marge were the prime suspects. Everyone was suddenly wary of them, and soon during a Police raid on the Simpsons House, the necklace was found with Maggie.
 Marge and Homer were arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for Mrs. Bellamy's murder. Just before their execution date, Homer confessed to everything so that Marge could live. 
 When Homer was strapped into the electric chair and the switch was pulled, it was revealed that all along they had been on Frame Up, a reality TV show.

 Her personality is uncharacteristically optimistic for a teacher at Springfield Elementary. She displays a certain degree of cheerfulness, confidence and competence (at least until she witnesses a failure of the buddy system), as opposed to being downbeat or exasperated like Edna Krabappel and Elizabeth Hoover, both of whom McConnell dislikes.
 Despite her upbeat demeanor, McConnell is shown to be very strict towards those who tattle and moan. In addition to this, she is also not the least bit sympathetic towards those who cry.
 All of these pet peeves are directed notably at Lisa, who despite being an A student is penalized for these things, due to constantly being paired up with her brother, Bart.
 This causes a great deal of animosity and friction between the two while they are in the same class, which McConnell is oblivious towards.
 She is later seen teaching the other fourth grade class, presuming that she switched from teaching third grade to fourth.

 When the Simpsons went to a ranch, Lisa was upset that everybody there was careless. Suddenly, a boy named Luke appears and Lisa takes a liking for him.
 Marge was then upset Lisa was growing up. Later Lisa discovered Luke had, what she believed to be, a girlfriend named Clara. When Lisa encountered her while riding a horse, she sent her the wrong way.
 Later, at the barn dance, Luke revealed that Clara was in fact his sister. Filled with regret, Lisa set out to save Clara, who had ended up falling into the middle of a river.
 Luke was unaware of her actions (for he says that Clara had not told him anything), before dumping her after she revealed to him that she had believed Clara to be his girlfriend and thus tried to keep them apart.
 Luke wears a blue t-shirt, blue jeans with a brown belt, brown cowboy boots, and a cowboy hat.

Goose Gladwell,True,False,False,False,False,16,Azaria,305,"Goose Gladwell is the owner of Goose's Gags and Gifts.
 Bart met Goose while trying to find a distributor for his T-shirts at the Springfield Novelty Expo. When Bart got frustrated and walked out of the expo, Goose accidentally ran into Bart with his car, scattering T-shirts everywhere. As Goose helped to gather up Bart's shirts, he was impressed with the slogans and offered to sell them in his stores. The shirts proved to be a hot seller and became nationally known, making plenty of money for both Goose and Bart.
 Goose later sold the T-shirt line to Disney and used some clever legal maneuvering to keep Bart from getting any money from the sale. However, when Homer threatened him with a home-made miniature nuclear reactor, Goose relented and gave Bart a large (but unspecified) amount of cash. He also gave Homer some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of Bart's homemade t-shirts, and a rapping toilet seat.
 Eccentric demeanor notwithstanding, Goose is more intelligent than he lets on. He seems to be skilled at breaking and entering, illusion, and gadgetry in general. When Goose visits the Simpson home, he manages to sneak into the house when they're all at the front answering the door. He also produces confetti and flowers (which he gives to Marge) from out of his hat, leaves from out of nowhere, and roller skates from out of the bottoms of his shoes. Another one of Goose's tricks is disappearing in his own shop (albeit not always successfully), thanks to a hidden trapdoor.
 Goose also has enough business sense to manage a successful chain of joke shops (which he tongue-in-cheekily refers to as ""over 20 stores in over 30 states"") and to retain lawyers to avoid paying Bart any of the proceeds from the sale of his T-shirt line.
 Goose says he was a Green Beret with the Marines and fought in Vietnam, and the things he saw there are what made him crazy.
 Goose is based on Willy Wonka, as portrayed by Gene Wilder in the 1971 movie Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory.

They attend prom together, and on the same night on a picnic, he proposes to her, but Jenda turns him down and breaks up with him due to him not having any plans for the future where he can provide for them. In order to win her back, Bart accepts an offer made by Mr. Burns to attend Yale on a scholarship, originally intended for Lisa. Jenda takes him back because he now has the scholarship and is ""someone."" Lisa, on the other hand, resigns herself to a life with Milhouse. Bart and Jenda take a walk and Jenda pressures Bart to have sex with her. Bart spots Professor Frink's house, remembering the astrology machine in the basement, and sees the dismal future Lisa has in store. Jenda is upset and demanding as she wanted to have sex with Bart and gives him an ultimatum: either Bart will take her now or leave her to save Lisa's future. Bart is torn between staying with Jenda and saving Lisa, but chooses Lisa and sets off to save Lisa, giving her the scholarship. It also implied that Jenda had a relationship with Todd Flanders.
 At some later point, Jenda and Bart reconciled and married having two sons together. However, the marriage eventually failed. Thirty years into the future the two have divorced with Jenda evidently keeping custody of their children, though she tries to keep Bart involved as their father. Jenda now has a new partner called Jerry.

Father Sean,True,True,False,False,False,16,stars,320,"He was the priest who was educating Bart Simpson in the Catholic Church. Bart was sent to St. Jerome's after being falsely expelled by Principal Skinner who blamed Groundskeeper Willie's prank on him from Springfield Elementary. On his first day of school at Saint Jerome's, Bart is penalized by a nun and told to hold up two dictionaries, in order to feel some of the pain Jesus Christ felt during his crucifixion. After finding Bart in the hallway, Father Sean regaled Bart with the tale of how he converted to Catholicism after a drunken fight with his father. After the fight, badly injured and lying against a lamp post, St. Peter appeared to Sean and told him to mend his rebellious ways. Father Sean gave Bart a comic book of the various saints in order to get Bart interested in the Roman Catholic faith. At home, Bart begins to show to his family his new found religious beliefs, which worries Marge. Homer, at Marge's request, goes to the school to talk to Father Sean. Upon seeing the pancake dinner/bingo night, Homer also becomes infatuated with the Catholic Church, and asks to celebrate the Sacrament of Confession.
 After realizing that he could not receive absolution without being a Catholic, both Homer and Bart decide to convert. Meanwhile, Marge (worried she might be alone in Protestant Heaven while Bart and Homer are in Catholic Heaven) seeks help from Rev. Lovejoy and Ned Flanders, who agree to get them back. While they are learning about First Communion, Marge, Rev. Lovejoy, and Ned capture Bart and bring him to a festival for The Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism. At the festival, Bart is told to listen to the band Quiet Riot (renamed to Pious Riot after their conversion) and play paintball, but never says he wishes to leave the Catholic Church. Homer and Fr. Sean arrive with a motorcycle, shoot Marge's hair with some paintball bullets and engage in a Mexican standoff with Ned and Lovejoy. Bart says it is stupid that all the different forms of Christianity are feuding when the main beliefs are the same. The two groups agree to both fight monogamous gays and stem cells and to take Bart's idea to heart. He also openly criticizes Buddhism.

Coach Krupt,True,True,False,False,False,17,Azaria,326,"Coach Krupt is the sadist gym teacher at Springfield Elementary School.
 He is obsessed with the game Bombardment, even yelling ""BOMBARDMENT"" at the end of most of his sentences. Bombardment consists of Krupt hitting students with dodgeballs thrown at full force. Krupt is relentless in playing the game, even ignoring medical orders that would excuse his students from participating (and prevent him from hurting them). Bart sneaked a peek at Krupt's calendar and saw that Krupt had Bombardment scheduled for every day, with ""Double Bombardment"" on Christmas Day. Krupt also plays Bombardment with bread rolls in restaurants. Krupt even brings Bombardment into academics: when the entire school got involved in preparing for the Vice President's Assessment Test, Krupt drilled his students with test questions while he drilled them with dodgeballs.
 Even when he is not playing Bombardment, Krupt still conforms to the ""sadistic gym teacher"" stereotype and finds other things to obsess over. One day in gym class, the scheduled activity was rope climbing and it was Milhouse's turn to climb, but the rope had disappeared. Krupt told Milhouse to climb anyway, forcing him to pantomime climbing a rope.
 Coach Krupt is athletic and in good physical shape, as one might expect of a gym teacher. When Bart tried to give Krupt his comeuppance by throwing an iceball at him, Krupt nimbly ducked out of the way and the iceball ended up flying out the gym window and then destroying Groundskeeper Willie's shack.
 Krupt came to Springfield Elementary as a substitute for gym teacher Ms. Pommelhorst, who was taking a leave of absence to undergo sex reassignment surgery. He has a wife and two children, a boy and a girl.

Melanie Upfoot,False,False,False,False,False,17,stars,330,"Melanie Upfoot was the temporary principal of Springfield Elementary in the episode ""Girls Just Want to Have Sums"". She split the school into two groups: boys and girls. 
 Melanie is a woman, who prefers New Age ideals over actual learning and her idea of being a feminist is very narrow minded. Melanie took over as the math teacher for the girls, however, she did not teach math, she used the subject for New Age lessons, talking about ""how numbers make you feel,"" ""what does a plus sign smell like"" and ""is the number seven odd, or just different"" while disapproving of men treating math like a problem that needs to be solved, none of these being actual math subjects as Math 'is' about solving problems. After Principal Skinner's comment that came off like he was saying that boys were better at math than girls, she took over his job and hired a math teacher to teach the 4th grade students math beyond their normal level. While the boys were taught 7th grade math, the girls were basically taught nothing besides her nonsensical philosophies. Melanie made multiple false claims about men mistreating women in absurd situations such as the time she told Chalmers that calling her by her first name was ""harassment"". Then, she made out with him later. She was replaced by Skinner as principal for an unknown reason (though likely due to her failure to properly educate the girls).

Darcy,False,False,False,True,False,18,stars,340,"Darcy is a 15-year-old girl that Bart Simpson once had a crush on from North Haverbrook.
 Bart Simpson, who recently acquired a driver's license (legally) as the reward of accidentally extinguishing a very large fire in town by driving up an uncontrollably fast go-kart filled with foam fuel from the hill nearby, explored the neighborhoods around and met Darcy, a cute teenage girl who was hanging out with her fancy-car-hooking-group of friends. After approaching Darcy, she got in his car, saw his physique and told him that he looked awfully young. Bart made up a story of him ""having that disease that makes you look like an old man, but they gave me medicine for it, and I took too much"" Darcy believes Bart to be 16. They quickly begin a romantic relationship, go on dates, and she soon proposes marriage. At the courthouse, she reveals that she is pregnant. Bart thought he knocked her up, causing him to tell his real age and flee (to no avail). However, Darcy confided to him that he couldn't be the father because pregnancy isn't the result of kissing but an act of intercourse. She then revealed that, all this time together, she thought Bart was just stupid at first, but this confirmed he couldn't be 16. Bart admitted he's actually both stupid and 10. The child is not Bart's; instead, the father is a Norwegian exchange student who already returned home. She wants to get married because her parents would be angry with her unwed pregnancy. In an act of uncharacteristic and oddly mature chivalry, Bart agrees to marry Darcy, and they drove to Utah, where marriage restrictions are known to be a 'little' loose, without parental consent and unconcern of age. He planned to raise his stepchild and their children together. Eventually, Homer, Marge and Darcy's parents catch up with them to stop them, knowing that she is older than him. Darcy's mother reveals that she is pregnant herself, and the family agrees to pass the two babies off as twins so as not to reveal Darcy's sin. Darcy and Bart end their relationship, while Bart, (in his own way) assures her they will meet again, to which she agrees.
 She reappears in a cameo in ""Moonshine River"", where Bart visits her at her house to ask for another chance at romance, but for some unspecified reason, she slams the door on him after saying, ""Drop dead."" It is also shown that Jimbo Jones is helping her in taking care of her baby and is also presumably her new boyfriend, as he had broken up with Shauna last season. It's possible that Darcy may have moved to Springfield. In the episode ""Habeas Tortoise"", she appeared as a cameo walking with her mother at Springfield City Zoo.

 When his sessions end, Bart starts to miss the time he spent with her and enters into a state of depression in which he talks about his problems to an empty chair while lying on his bed. He peeks into her window and sees her counseling Milhouse Van Houten. He hangs his head while biking in the rain when he looks through a window and sees her dancing with a married owner of the Chinese restaurant next door to her office.
 Marge, worried, pays for one more session with Dr. Swanson. When it ends, Bart feels that he has been able to get everything off his chest. As Bart says goodbye, Dr. Swanson starts to miss him and begins to obsess over him. While seeing her own psychiatrist, it is revealed during their session that ""Dark Stanley"" was in fact real, and had killed her own son.

 When Comic Book Guy banned every kid in Springfield from coming to his store, he sarcastically suggested they should go to another comic book store. To his surprise, there actually was another store: Coolsville Comics &amp; Toys, which had just opened right across the street.
 When the kids went to Coolsville, they met the owner, Milo, who treated them like royalty. He gave them Japanese hard candy and played Korean-language Tom Jones music for them. Milo became even more popular with the kids when he had Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, and Daniel Clowes appearing in his store for an autograph session. This prompted Comic Book Guy, desperate for business, to visit and try to sell the kids ninja weapons; the kids, however, weren't interested in the weapons, and Comic Book Guy ended up getting scolded for trying to sell dangerous weapons to children, and then beaten up by the three visiting artists. Comic Book Guy later went out of business, and his empty building was purchased by Marge Simpson, who turned it into Shapes, a women's fitness center (but it was all in Homer's dream and Marge didn't purchase the building and so Comic Book Guy didn't go out of business and kept store going, despite Milo having a much better comic book store than he does).
 Unlike Comic Book Guy, Milo's nothing like the stereotypical comic book fan: he's slim, trendy, and he has a girlfriend. Milo also doesn't force his opinions on other people, but shows that he values and respects other people's opinions when he asks the kids what they think about questions and topics related to comic books. Milo believes that comics are made to be read and enjoyed, rather than hoarded away until they're valuable. He's much more favored by the kids than Comic Book Guy.
 Unlike Comic Book Guy, who had the only comic book store in town and used that fact to be mean and sarcastic to his customers without fear of losing business, Milo knows that being nice to the kids (and customers in general) is necessary for his business to be profitable. He's very polite to children and doesn't mind if the kids accidentally damage a comic book (such as when Lisa Simpson accidentally ripped a page in a Tintin book). Milo arranges for famous alternative comic book writers to visit, and his store's a lot bigger than The Android's Dungeon and carries a lot merchandise and memorabilia.
 Milo knows virtually everything there is to know stuff related to comic books, from character strengths to superpowers.
 As previously, Milo, much to the shock of the comic collector stereotype, has a girlfriend: a woman named Strawberry who uses a Malibu Stacy lunch box for a purse. In Married to the Blob, he and Strawberry apparently get married and have a daughter.
 Milo was voiced by Jack Black in Husbands and Knives. Maurice LaMarche provided his voice in Married to the Blob.

Royce Lumpkin,True,False,False,False,False,19,Wiedergott,360,"Ex-Wife: (Unnamed) Royce Boss Hogg Lumpkin is the deadbeat father of Lurleen Lumpkin.
 Royce seems to be a neglectful, uncaring jerk and overall horrible father, to a point of even leaving his daughter once again despite all her problems she is going through right now. He also stole Lurleen’s song, and changed to be used by the Dixie Chicks.
 Royce abandoned Lurleen when she was four years old. He didn't reappear in her life until thirty years later, when Marge Simpson tracked him down. Royce and Lurleen had a joyous father-daughter reunion, which inspired Lurleen to write a song called ""My Daddy's Back.""
 All too soon, however, Royce reverted to type and abandoned Lurleen again. This time, he went one step further: He took Lurleen's song, ""My Daddy's Back,"" re-wrote the lyrics and gave it to the Dixie Chicks as ""America's Back,"" telling them that he had written the song. When Lurleen saw The Dixie Chicks (with Royce) performing ""America's Back"" on TV, she immediately realized what had happened and was heartbroken. Later, however, with Homer's and Marge's support, Lurleen tracked Royce down and confronted him with the theft. When The Dixie Chicks learned of the theft, they joined with Lurleen in beating up Royce with their instruments.
 Royce was also working on another version of ""My Daddy's Back"" to make into a Chevy ad, but he wasn't able to finish it before Lurleen confronted him.
 Royce's personal trademark (aside from his dishonesty) is that he does a very good hambone dance. Also, to Homer's envy, Royce has a full head of hair.

Maya,False,False,False,False,False,20,MacNeille,370,"Maya is a beautiful woman whom Moe met over the Internet. She’s a little person, standing at about three feet tall.
 While Moe and Maya were corresponding online, Moe was captivated by her looks, and by the fact that she liked his jokes and thought his photo was cute. When they met in person, Moe was shocked to see just how small Maya was. In Maya's online pictures showing her posing next to famous landmarks, camera angles plus the fact that she was actually in Legoland posing with small-scale replicas of the landmarks had made her appear to be of average height.
 Despite this, they ended up hitting it off and had a good time going on dates. Moe worried what his friends and bar patrons would think of her, but Homer and Marge didn't even pay attention to her height, instead being impressed by her looks and her knowledge of how a Power Plant works.
 Maya nearly married Moe, but he got too comfortable joking with her about her height, much to her chagrin. Moe tried to make it up to her by arranging to have a risky height-reduction surgery (to literally knock himself down to her size), but she convinced him not to. She was touched by how much he cared for her after he told her that being with her was something he cherished. However, she left Moe because she was put off by his willingness to try something so crazy, and also because she wanted to be with a man who was truly comfortable with her size. Moe's seeking the surgery, therefore, showed Maya that he wasn't the right man for her.
 Moe was sad to see Maya leave, but he had many happy memories of her and kept her picture in his bar.
 During the episode, Homer states that ""if someone loved you once, they can love again."" This could be a possible suggestion that Maya may come back, which eventually happens later.
 Maya made a non-speaking cameo in ""The Great Simpsina"" among other small magicians, in a room opened by Raymondo, which suggests that Maya could be a stage magician.
 Maya also appeared in the episode ""Treehouse of Horror XXIV"", in the third segment ""Freaks No Geeks"".
 Maya next appeared in ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"", where she was playing Peekimon Get.
 At the end of ""Flanders' Ladder"", she is shown to be one of the many wives of Ned Flanders.
 In ""From Russia Without Love"", Maya was seen in a flashback and mentioned by Moe as one of the women who broke his heart.
 She returned in the Season 33 episode ""The Wayz We Were"", where she and Moe reunite. It appears Maya has forgiven him and invited him to talk. They get back together and are now engaged to be married.

Jenny,False,False,False,False,False,20,stars,371,"Jenny is a young girl with whom Bart briefly fell in love in ""The Good, the Sad and the Drugly"". 
 Bart first met her after seeing her volunteer at the Springfield Retirement Castle. She was a Christian and prayed to God at school. At first, she thought Bart was a nice guy, but then she dumped him when he admitted his bad side to her when Milhouse began to jeopardize their relationship without her knowledge. Jenny is about 11 years old, as she is in the fifth grade. She reappeared in a cameo in ""Moonshine River"", where Bart visits her at her house to ask for another chance. She is obviously still angry at him for lying to her; and reverting back to his mischievous behavior. She says ""Eat my shorts!"" upon seeing him before slamming the door.
 Jenny seems to have numerous similarities to Bart's previous crushes, a subject that has been touched upon by the episode's reviewers. She is older than Bart, like Laura Powers and Darcy, but she isn't a teenager. Bart also had to hide his bad side from her, just like what he did temporarily with Jessica Lovejoy. Additionally, she put a strain on Bart and Milhouse's friendship, just like Greta Wolfcastle did; however, Jenny wasn't aware of it as she continued to date Bart, while Greta went out with Milhouse only to get back at Bart when he dumped her. In addition, she is also similar in appearance to Samantha, a girl whom Milhouse briefly dated, and who also unknowingly jeopardized Bart and Milhouse's friendship.

First episode appearance
""Waverly Hills, 9-0-2-1-D'oh""


Portrayed by
Elliot Page


 Alaska Nebraska is a famous pop singer and actress who is beloved by children from Waverly Hills.
 Alaska is a 16-year-old pop singer, ""Touch a Star"" and ""Make it Yours (The Star Song)"" are songs that are mentioned in the episode. She claims that she was once a little girl who did not fit in, so she got a new nose and got famous where she is today. She also mentioned that she was dating the starting point guard of the Los Angeles Clippers.
 She also has her own TV show, named after her, that was old enough to be featured on the Butt-Whisperer 4000 treadmill. Homer rejected seeing the show among the streaming options as he's already seen it.
 Alaska likes to meditate, and she lip-syncs her conversations. She talks in a monotone.
 She is small with long blonde hair, deep set eyes with unusually long eyelashes. She has had nose plastic surgery.
 She recently appears in The Simpsons: Tapped Out during the Homerpalooza 2017 Event as a background character.
 She is voiced by Elliot Page, and is a parody of pop singer Miley Cyrus, who achieved wide fame for her role as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel sitcom Hannah Montana. Her name is based on the two American States, 'Alaska' and 'Nebraska'.

Zachary Vaughn,True,False,False,False,False,21,Azaria,375,"Zachary Vaughn annoyed by ""Stan's"" Groot cosplay. Zachary Vaughn is the teacher that replaced Edna Krabappel as the fourth-grade teacher at Springfield Elementary School.
 He was thought to be cool by most of the kids, using Facebook, Twitter and sending text messages to the kids instead of giving them actual work. He was fired after he put vodka in his Blue Bronco Energy Drink and insulted the students while drunk. He had only just gotten a Master's in education at Tufts University before he took on that fourth-grade class. Ironically, Bart considered doing the exact same thing to him in an attempt to get Krabappel back before deciding instead to admit he was responsible for Krabappel's firing and take any punishment so long as she is brought back and made clear he did not spike his drink when Skinner heard the commotion. They were his first class ever.
 He has made a cameo appearance in ""The Day the Earth Stood Cool"" talking to some of T-Rex birthday party's guests.
 His following appearance would be in Bart the Bad Guy at the queue to watch Vindicators: Crystal War.
 In Better Off Ned, he's one of the participants of the Prayer Chain Ned Flanders wanted to threaten Superintendent Chalmers with.
 He then appeared in Podcast News twice; first during Tabitha Shingle's live recording of her podcast Interminable and then during Kent Brockman's live presentation of his podcast Guilty Grampa.
 During Do PizzaBots Dream of Electric Guitars? credits, he's seen as one of the characters annoyed by ""Stan's"" Groot cosplay.
 Vaughn at the queue to watch Vindicators: Crystal War. He appears during the opening sequence for Homer's Adventures Through The Windshield Glass, next to Halle Berry and Cheech &amp; Chong.

Andy Hamilton,True,True,False,False,False,21,stars,377,"Andrew ""Andy"" Hamilton is a former student at Springfield Elementary School and is said to be the best prankster ever. He is currently a writer for The Krusty the Clown Show. Bart Simpson saved Andy's pranking career by telling him that he has to grow up.
 Andy's first and most famous prank was when Andy was a student at Springfield Elementary School, and Seymour Skinner loved to swim in the school's early swimming pool (revealed by Groundskeeper Willie). Andy filled the pool with worms and locked Skinner in the pool for a whole weekend, including Monday, a teacher's holiday. The prank was named ""Night of the Wigglers"".
 Later, Bart and Milhouse meet Andy and learn that he is unemployed and lives with his mother. Bart gets Andy a job to be Krusty's advisor, but he quits after his first day because he couldn’t handle having someone of a higher authority than him. Andy later gets rehired by Krusty, but Bart is worried when he sees a worm truck driving into the studio. Bart thinks Andy will repeat the ""Night of the Wigglers"" prank, but it turns out that he got worms for Krusty's act of falling into a pool of worms. Krusty made Andy his writer, and he is now employed.
 Currently, Andy is still writing for Krusty. He also has a girlfriend who works for Krusty in the makeup department (which she calls the ""makeout department""). Andy still lives with his mother, but thinks that it's fine.
 He was named after Andrew ""Andy"" Hamilton of Chicago, Illinois who was the first fan to email the writers after Homer revealed his Email as Chunkylover53@aol.com in the episode ""The Dad Who Knew Too Little"".

 Lisa stumbles upon the three Wiccans while she was lost in the woods while playing hide n' seek with some of Cletus's children. Lisa accepts to join these teenagers, but they are arrested as Lisa is doing the ceremony. As the case was still going on, half of Springfield went blind and accused these girls of cursing them. The judge drops the case as there is no real evidence - but the people of Springfield still want these girls bought to justice. They are taken to be dunked in Lake Springfield to see if they are witches. Just before they are to be dunked, Lisa explains the real reason why everyone was blind: hillbillies (after discovering Homer's moonshine tasting talent) hold a moonshine fair with their own homemade moonshine for Homer to judge. Whilst the police were coming to arrest the Wiccans, the hillbillies think they are coming to arrest them; they dump it all in the river causing everyone to drink it blind. The three teenagers are saved from being dunked by Lisa. Marge thinks they are nice girls but forbids Lisa to go near them ever again.

Princess Penelope,False,False,False,False,False,21,stars,380,"Penelope Owsley, also known as Princess Penelope, was a new addition on The Krusty the Clown Show, originally put in to attract more female viewers. She was almost married to Krusty the Clown.
 Penelope grew up in Mineola, New York, a village on Long Island.
 Penelope was a new addition to the Krusty the Clown Show, as his producers found out that they were losing the female demographic. Krusty accepted the new addition, only to get tired of her girly antics very soon, quickly losing male viewers instead. When Krusty tried to confront Penelope however, she revealed to him how she joined mainly because of him, being his biggest fan since childhood. After this revelation, Krusty and Penelope start a relationship.
 The Krusty the Clown Show episodes soon after feature them singing love songs to one another, with Krusty culminating in asking Penelope's hand in marriage, to which she agrees heartily. On their wedding day, Bart and Milhouse try to sabotage the ceremony by showing Penelope Krusty's array of ex-wives, including Holly Hippie and Eartha Kitt, both of whom despise him. Penelope still desires to be wed to Krusty, but Krusty believes that he is not worth Penelope's love and cancels the wedding.
 Penelope then moves to France and sadly sings her songs on her guitar at a local café. When walking on the Seine river bridge, she looks down at the water. A boat passes by, and she sees Krusty's reflection on the water next to hers. She turns around, expecting to see him, only to see nothing. Krusty is actually there though, he was just in the water. She flings herself in the water, happy that he changed his mind, and the two float down the river, staying afloat using Penelope's wooden guitar's case where they kiss.
 It's unknown what happens with them, but as in later episodes, Krusty was seen interested in other women, it's possible he and Penelope broke up.
 Penelope wears a beautiful pink dress (similar to that of Disney princesses). She has dark brown hair and wears long white gloves with fingers cut off and pink shoes with bows. She also wears pink lipstick, magenta stick earrings, a necklace with a star, and a blue tiara on her head.
 In Paris, Penelope wears a simple black shirt with black pants and matching black shoes.
 According to The Simpsons: Tapped Out mobile game, Penelope left Krusty. In the game, she is again used to diversify Krusty's demographic, but this time for his theme park Krustyland.

On their journey, the two began to fall in love and even encountered Abraham Lincoln who offered his top hat to conceal Mabel's hair from the authorities. Mabel and Virgil successfully crossed the border into Canada via a bridge upon which Virgil proposed to Mabel. Mabel legally divorced Hiram and married Virgil, who took his wife's previous married name of ""Simpson"" since he did not have one of his own and ""so that Mabel could keep all her monogram table linens."" Mabel and Virgil Simpson then had a child, Abraham, who was Grampa Simpson's great grandfather and presumably his namesake. A family tree showing Virgil Simpson's known descendants can be seen here.
 In The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album, Virgil, Hiram, and the original Abraham's names do not appear at all in the family tree, with Grampa's paternal great-grandfather called Howland Simpson and his paternal great-great grandfather being called Garwood Simpson.

Mabel Simpson,False,False,False,True,False,21,Kavner,385,"Mabeline ""Mabel"" Simpson was an ancestor of the Simpson family and the great-great-great grandmother of Homer Simpson. Mabel's first husband was Hiram Simpson (with whom she had one child, Eliza) and her second husband was Virgil (with whom she had another child, Abraham). She is also an ancestor of the Van Houten Family through Eliza's marriage to Milford Van Houten.
 She and her family worked with the underground railroad, but when her husband Hiram betrayed their activities to the slave owning Colonel Burns, she fled with the runaway slave Virgil to Canada, meeting Abraham Lincoln along the way, who offered that she cover her conspicuous hair with his stovepipe top hat. Later, she legally divorced Hiram (also getting one of his shoes in the divorce settlement although he keeps the laces) and married Virgil, who had proposed to her on a bridge marking the border between the United States and Canada. Since Virgil had no last name he took the surname ""Simpson."" Mabel and Virgil had one known child, Abraham, whom they presumably named after Abraham Lincoln and who himself is the presumed namesake of Abe ""Grampa"" Simpson, Mabel's great-great-grandchild. She is identical to Marge, which is strange, because Marge is a Simpson by marriage, so it doesn't make much sense.

Hiram Simpson,True,False,False,True,False,21,Castellaneta,386,"Hiram Flinicius Simpson (born: Hiram Joseph Simpson) was a sharecropper in Springfield during the antebellum era, working under the plantation owner Colonel Burns. He was married to Mabel Simpson, but after he betrayed Virgil, Mabel divorced him. Despite his surname and striking resemblance to Homer, he is not actually an ancestor of the modern Simpson Family, nor does he have any form of relation to them. He is the father of Eliza Simpson, who is an ancestor of the Van Houten Family.
 By 1860, Hiram had begun working for Colonel Wainwright Montgomery Burns as a sharecropper. He was the first husband of Mabel Simpson, and they had one child, Eliza Simpson. The family worked with the underground railroad, helping slaves flee to Canada. In April, 1860, his daughter brought home a slave named Virgil. Not wanting trouble with Colonel Burns, he wanted to give him back (or send him elsewhere). However, he allowed him to stay in the turnip shed after trying his wheel cake.
 Hiram, despite trying to stand by his oath to help Virgil, turned against his family and slave under their care, by betraying Virgil to Colonel Burns in exchange for a new pair of shoes. Mabel, however, left her husband to help Virgil escape to Canada, and fell in love with him along the way. Mabel divorced Hiram (getting one of his new shoes in the settlement although he kept the laces) and then married Virgil beginning the family tree from which the modern-day Simpsons descend. The divorce possibly had a quite large effect on him, as he was shown in an ancestry picture taken in the later-1860s as annoyed.
 If the story Grandpa told was true, then he is an ancestor of the Van Houten family but not the modern Simpsons themselves. Since Virgil's position in the family is the great-great-great-great grandfather, it is possible that Hiram and Eliza are related to the generations from The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album that came before the Hiram-Virgil cutoff. According to Abe, his family kept Virgil's existence a secret to avoid racist remarks at the time, which they may have also tampered with the family tree (such as removing Hiram, Mabel and Eliza from the tree) to deny any affiliation with Virgil. 
 It is unknown when Hiram died, or if he continued to work under Colonel Burns after his divorce. It is unclear if he was alive by the time Eliza married Milford Van Houten.

Eliza Simpson,False,True,False,True,False,21,Smith,387,"During the era of the Civil War, Eliza helped Virgil, a black slave, escape from Colonel Burns. She sheltered him in her house and forced her parents, Hiram and Mabel, into promising they won't tell anyone about Virgil's presence. However, Colonel Burns deduced where Virgil had gone and arrived at the Simpson home, forcing Hiram into revealing his location by offering shoes as gifts. Eliza tried to stop Colonel Burns, but he told her little girls should be ""seen, not heard"", to which she sadly agrees. However, Mabel runs off with Virgil to Canada and eventually marries him, divorcing Hiram. At first, it was believed by Lisa that Eliza was the antecedent of the modern Simpson family, until it was revealed that she was merely a distant relative, and maternal half-sister to the Simpsons true direct ancestor, Abraham Simpson I.
 Eliza in year 1952 (aged 100). In a 1952 interview, there is a wedding photo in the background showing that Eliza ended up marrying Milford Van Houten, making Lisa and Milhouse distantly related, as they are both descended from Eliza's mother, Mabel. In the interview, she tells that she only regrets not stopping Burns in finding Virgil, implying she never found out about Virgil's successful escape.

Nikki,False,False,False,False,False,21,stars,389,"Nicole Nell ""Nikki"" McKenna is a student of Springfield Elementary School.
 When Mrs. Krabappel takes a leave of absence, Bart's class has to share a room with the school's other fourth-grade class. Bart ends up having to sit in the back of the class with Nikki, and he gently flirts with her. At first glance, Nikki seems to be bothered by Bart until he asks to draw on her shoulder. Bart asks Grandpa for advice, and his recommendation was to plant a kiss on Nikki. The next day, Nikki and Bart go freestyle on their skateboards, and they end up on top of a slide, where Bart steals a kiss. However, Nikki freaks out and yells in disgust. Nikki's parents later have a meeting with Homer and Marge, and Principal Skinner decides to make a policy of no-physical-contact in Springfield Elementary, or ""Hands-Off"".
 After a disastrous school meeting, Nikki surprises Bart at his locker and they smooch. The couple later see First Lady Michelle Obama at the school roof while on the roof. Bart reveals his feelings for Nikki, but she rejects his feelings again. As a result, Bart stumbles off the roof, causing her to worry until he starts breathing. She performed CPR emergency mouth-to-mouth to save Bart, despite the Hands-Off policy. In the last moments of their relationship, Bart asks why she kept changing her mind about him, to which she states there are things Bart has yet to learn about women, and that is why she will never tell him. Bart then says he will smell her later and she kisses his cheek; as she walks off, he says he loves her.
 She is later seen with her father at Springfield General Hospital, trying to get a vaccine for the ""Housecat Virus"", only to make way for Mr. Burns when he addressed the crowd. She is seen with her parents as background characters in the school (after he sees his parents in school auction). She reappears in a cameo in ""Moonshine River"", where Bart visits her house to ask for another chance, but once again, she continues to flip-flop between loving and hating him. Finally, Bart gets frustrated and simply leaves.
 Nikki seems to love skateboarding, and rides a purple 70s-style skateboard. Like Bart, she seems to be a rebel, but apparently with a better reputation. Nikki also likes vampires and reading novels such as Red Moon, (a parody of the novel New Moon, which is part of the Twilight series, and of the BBC Sitcom, Red Dwarf).

Walt Warren,True,False,False,False,False,21,Grammer,392,"Walt is generally a mild-mannered person, but he was arrested for a minor offense and he got sentenced to a term in Springfield Penitentiary, where he had the misfortune of being cellmates with Sideshow Bob. Due to budget cutbacks, the city of Springfield announced that all minor offenders would be released from prison. Bob, hearing of this, noted the similarities in height and facial structure between himself and Walt and hatched a plan to escape and make another attempt to murder Bart Simpson. The night before the minor offenders' release, Bob knocked Walt out and performed facial transplant surgery, putting his own face and hair on Walt and vice versa. Then, the next morning when the minor offenders were set free, Bob simply walked out of prison in place of Walt (who was still unconscious from the surgery).
 Walt, for his part, immediately realized what had happened and tried to warn the prison guards. He tried to tell them, but he was unable to talk correctly after the surgery. Mistaking him for Sideshow Bob and he had gone crazy, the guards put Walt in a straitjacket and locked him in a padded cell. Meanwhile, Bob, impersonating Walt, had moved in next door to the Simpsons, but Bart was suspicious and insisted on making sure Bob was still in prison. Marge took Bart to visit the prison, where they saw the real Walt (looking like Sideshow Bob) in his straitjacket repeatedly writing ""BART SIMPSON WILL DIE"" on the walls with a pen clenched in his teeth. Walt was still trying to warn people of Bob's plot, but his writing on the wall was misinterpreted as Bob's usual behaviour of threatening Bart.
 Soon after that, Walt escaped from prison himself. He pretended to choke on his pen and then spat it into the eye of the guard who came to assist him. Still in his straitjacket, he grabbed the guard's taser in his teeth, zapped the guard, and made his escape. Walt then went to the Simpson home to warn them, but they mistake him for Bob, until Walt took off his shoes and revealed his normal-sized feet. Because Sideshow Bob had huge feet, the Simpsons finally believed Walt's story, and Walt explained everything that had happened. Then, searching Bob's house, they found clues indicating that Bob was planning to murder Bart at Five Corners so he could have immunity from prosecution, so they all went in pursuit of Bob, who had already kidnapped Bart.
 Along the way, they stopped at a diner, where Bob had left a false trail (with a waitress who found ""Walt"" attractive) indicating he was headed for Mexico. The Simpsons believed the waitress and headed for Mexico, but Walt picked up on the waitress's attraction, didn't believe her, and continued on to Five Corners. He arrived in time to stop Bob from murdering Bart by disarming him, but a bee got caught under the face and allowed Bob to rearm himself, before Bob could commit the crime police from all five states arrived and the New Jersey cops arrested Bob and charged him for impersonation, kidnapping, unlicensed use of a firearm and attempted murder.
 Once all of the questions about his identity were resolved, Walt was a free man, having been officially released from prison. He moved away from the Simpsons' neighborhood and it's unknown where he ended up after all that. It is also implied that Walt was granted plastic surgery restoring his true appearance, since Bob is later seen back in his original appearance in later Episodes. The episode Bobby, It's Cold Outside confirms such was the case, where a flashback to Bob's dark past featured Bob, after his latest escape from prison by disguising himself as a visiting priest, briefly has his face almost come off via a gust of wind only for him to reattach it in time.

Zia Simpson,False,True,False,False,False,23,Cartwright,395,"Zia Eliza Simpson-Van Houten (Born: 2028) is the future daughter of Lisa and Milhouse in ""Holidays of Future Passed"". She is 13 years old.
 Zia looks near identical to her mother, Lisa, due to apparently only having her genes. Zia's hair is similar to Lisa's, except it is rounded instead of pointed, and she has a longer lock of blue hair, which may have come from Milhouse's genes, although due to apparently not having any of his genetic material it could have been inherited from her maternal grandmother, Marge, or she dyed it. She has a changing blue tattoo on her left arm, one of which is the Taoist symbol the Yin Yang, a peace sign, and a biohazard sign.
 She wears a purple crop top, a magenta skirt with a dark grey belt and purple straps on the side, dark magenta boots with magenta soles and straps, and a magenta bracelet on her left arm.
 Unlike her mother Lisa, Zia is quite arrogant and selfish and speaks to her parents in a rude manner, although she dislikes stereotypically feminine things as her mother does. She is an obsessed teen who goes online on the internet.
 Despite her selfish behavior, Zia and Lisa have a heart-to-heart towards the end of ""Holidays of Future Passed"" where they reconcile, and she is even seen happily making popcorn strings with her family members.
 Lisa with her husband, Milhouse and their daughter, Zia. Lisa became pregnant with Zia in 2027, as seen in the montage of family Christmas photos, and the next year, in 2028, Lisa and Milhouse are seen with an infant Zia. So, Zia was born in either late 2027 or 2028, making her either 13 or 14 years old as of December 2041, in which ""Holidays of Future Passed"" takes place in. She is then shown in Lisa's family Christmas photo for 2041, sitting with her parents on their couch with her headphones in, looking bored.
 According to Milhouse, the genetic engineering technology allows Zia to have all the good features, thus containing none of his genes.
 Zia spends much of her time plugged into the Ultranet, and in doing so somewhat annoys and worries her mother. When she is not plugged in, she is shown to be sarcastic and arrogant around Lisa, shooting down her mother's attempt to connect with her. Her rebellious nature leads Lisa to think that Zia doesn't respect her, stating that Zia thinks she's a ""ruthless tyrant"", and questioning how it was her daughter that turned her brother, where ironically, she acted no different as a child towards Marge, her own mother.
 Lisa brings Zia with her to her parent's home for Christmas while Milhouse nurses his seasonal allergies, but Zia plugs herself into the Ultranet for almost the entire time.
 Lisa entering Zia's Ultranet Room. Worried, Lisa enters the Ultranet to check up on Zia despite her own feelings and Marge's advice to just leave her alone.
 Zia and Lisa reconciling. Lisa finds Zia's Ultranet Room to be filled with things dealing with science and other studies, and there are posters in her wall of women such as Joan of Arc, Marie Curie, and Lisa herself.
 Zia appears from chemicals out of a beaker, after questioning what Lisa is doing there. Lisa tells Zia, who defensively asks if she assumed she was doing shady things, that she's sorry for invading her privacy, and that she only did it out of concern, but she's glad because she learned that her daughter looks up to her. Zia replies that she looks up to both of her parents, but she especially looks up to her mother, and they both hug. As they do this, a door to another room, a dance club, opens slightly behind them. Zia quickly closes the door before her mom notices.
 Zia appears with the rest of her family at the end of the episode, at the Simpson's house on Christmas Day. After Maggie arrives home with her baby girl, Zia and everyone else gather around for a Christmas photo
 Zia with the rest of her family in their Christmas photo. A photograph of Zia, Lisa, and Homer can be briefly seen in The Simpson family's living room in ""Days of Future Future"". Besides that, Zia does not appear nor is it even mentioned in the aforementioned episode.
 Zia (as adult) appears for Thanksgiving dinner with the entire family (including Patty and Selma) and her mother talking about the event of the power outage in ""It's a Blunderful Life"".

 On The Simpsons, she voiced herself in the episode ""Mr. Plow,"" in which she appeared with Barney in a Plow King ad, singing his jingle.
 Linda Ronstadt recorded her lines for the episode from San Francisco with Jon Vitti.
 This wasn't Ronstadt's first time recording a commercial jingle; in the late 1960s, as she was starting her career as a solo artist, she recorded a radio jingle for Remington Electric Shavers written by Frank Zappa; it was never broadcast.
 Ironically, even though at the time of recording her appearance in The Simpsons was in the midst of a series of Spanish-language albums - reflected in her suggesting to Barney a Spanish version of the Plow King jingle - the actual Spanish dub of the episode features someone else singing the translated jingle and dialogue, rather than Ronstadt herself.

George Harrison,,False,False,False,False,1,,413,"
George Harrison (25 February, 1943 - 29 November, 2001) was an English rock musician and songwriter, most famous for being a member of The Beatles.
 With The Beatles, Harrison's primary role was lead guitarist; however, he also wrote several Beatles songs, singing lead vocal on every one of them. Harrison also sang lead on several other songs, including ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"".
 After the Beatles broke up, Harrison went on to a successful solo music career, achieving a number one hit with ""My Sweet Lord"". He later also became a record and film producer.
 On The Simpsons, Harrison appeared as himself in the episode ""Homer's Barbershop Quartet"". During filming, Harrison was said to be rather friendly and humble to the cast, but was rather disinterested to answer questions from the cast about the Beatles. However, when Matt Groening asked questions about one of Harrison’s solo album, the Wonderwall Music, Harrison was happy to answer those questions. 
 Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001, aged 58, after a long two-year battle after being diagnosed in May of 2001.

The latter seems to be true since off screen Comic Book Guy remarks, ""You almost had it there.""
 Stan Lee was an American comic book writer, editor, actor, producer, publisher, television personality, and the former president and chairman of Marvel Comics, where he helped constitute their modern comics universe, by co-creating characters such as the Incredible Hulk, Thor, Iron Man (as well as the Avengers, the hero team these characters comprise), Spider-Man, and the X-Men. When he appeared in The Simpsons, he named himself ""the king of the cameos"" in a parody to the fact that he appeared in all his Marvel movies and animated series.
 On November 12, 2018, Stan Lee died of Pneumonia in Los Angeles, California at the age of 95. At the time of his death, he had already completed filming cameos in the next five Marvel movies.
